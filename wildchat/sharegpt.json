At the core of the ecosystem is the Fresh Earth Token, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that manages the food ecosystem business. The token represents fractional ownership of the ecosystem, and is valued based on both the value of the ecosystem's assets and the future impact of regenerative projects on the environment and society. The Fresh Earth ecosystem is designed to incentivize participation and engagement through a variety of different Incentive Drivers and includes a B2B and B2C marketplace, a digital collaborative community, a validation system, and a rewards system. The ecosystem aims to provide a comprehensive, community-based food system that empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume, while also promoting sustainable practices and addressing the pressing issues of climate change, health, and food security.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe world is currently facing a number of pressing interlinking issues including climate change, health, and food security. The Fresh Earth ecosystem aims to address these issues by promoting regenerative agriculture practices and creating a comprehensive, community-based food system that empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume, while regenerating the environment. \n\nTo write when finished Whitepaper. Include:\n\nPurpose and goals of the token: To create a sustainable and regenerative food system, to support farmers and communities, and to align incentives for token holders and the ecosystem growth\n\nToken classification: Utility token, ERC-20, or any other relevant classification\n\nSummarise what follows\n\n2. Background\nContext: Agrifood-health-environment\nThe world is currently facing a number of pressing interlinking issues including climate change, health, and food security. \n\nClimate change and environmental degradation are causing extreme weather events and altering growing conditions, threatening to cross tipping points for the biosphere and the continuance of civilization as we have known it. Industrial agriculture by itself is the major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, pollution, biodiversity loss, and decline in soil health and water availability. This is resulting in reduced crop yields and increased food insecurity, which is putting added pressure on farmers to produce more food using conventional, industrial agricultural practices that accelerate degrade the environmental degradation. \n\nOn the health front, the agri-food industry is facing challenges as a result of soil degradation and chemical inputs, leading to a decrease in nutritional density of food and an increase in food-borne illnesses and food toxicity. Furthermore, the current industrial agriculture system is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, contributing to air and water pollution, and negatively impacting the health of farmers and rural communities.\n\nThe current food system is inadequate in addressing food security issues, with millions of people suffering from hunger and malnourishment. It is estimated that around 33% of global food production is lost or wasted, while around 800 million people suffer from hunger and malnutrition. The industrial agriculture system is designed for maximum efficiency and profit, rather than for the benefit of communities and the environment. This has led to monoculture farming, overuse of chemicals, and a lack of diversity in the food system, all of which contribute to poor health and food insecurity. \n\nConsumers are becoming aware of these environmental and heath problems and are increasingly demanding high-quality, sustainably produced food, and the market for organic and functional food is growing rapidly. To address these challenges, there is a growing movement towards regenerative agriculture practices, which focus on regenerating soil health, water availability, and biodiversity while producing food in a sustainable manner. \n\nHowever, the lack of coordination and fragmentation in the agricultural industry makes it difficult for small farmers and regenerative agriculture projects to access the capital needed to transition to sustainanble and regenerative practices, and scale up their operations.\n\nThe Fresh Earth ecosystem aims to address these issues by promoting regenerative agriculture practices and creating a comprehensive, community-based food system that empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume.\n\nThe deep problem - the economic system\nExternalization of costs\nThe current economic system, which prioritizes capitalism and consumerism, fails to account for the true cost of industrial agriculture, or commerce generally, on the environment and human health. Farmers who want to grow crops using sustainable methods have to invest in the transition only to find they are is outcompeted by industrial practices that have not internalised their true costs to environment and health. This leads to unsustainable practices, such as monoculture and heavy use of chemical inputs, that degrade the soil, reduce biodiversity and increase greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. These externalised costs are effectively subsidised by the individuals of the society who ultimately bear the cost of damages to environment and health. On a true free market baiss, with all costs accounted for, the regenerative and degenerative methods can compete on an equal basis. The degenerative methods with their burden of environmental, health and expensive inputs costs (fertiliser, pesticides etc) are no longer competitive with regenerative practices that do not have these costs. Additionally in a world where regeneration is valued it can become an additional source of income, ultimately making the regenerative products cheaper. This highlights the need for a comprehensive accounting of natural capital and internalization of environmental and health costs in order to create a more sustainable and equitable economic system.\n\nThe Monetary system\n\nThe monetary system, which is based on fractional reserve banking and debt-based money creation, also exacerbates this issue by creating a cycle of debt repayment. The root of this problem lies in the way that money is created and the lack of accounting for natural capital. Most money is created by commercial banks originating loans (\u201cPromises to Repay\u201d), which creates an increase in deposit accounts (\u201cMoney\u201d). This creates a cycle of loan repayment that must come from some form of commerce, predominatly based based on fossil fuel energy. Because there is no accounting for natural capital, the ultimate source of the repayment is a reduction in natural capital assets, i.e. the destruction of environmental and health assets. This is seen in IMF loans to third world countries that are permanently indebted and required to mine their natural capital, even their food, to pay the interest.\n\nFurthermore, this would be the case even if the energy source were some form of non-polluting, free energy. Greenhouse gas damage is only a fraction of the total environmental and health cost of the commerce systema. As long as the destruction of nature is free of cost, and money is debt based withotu regard to social value, the competitive race to the bottom will ensure that nature and health are destroyed even faster. This highlights the need for a comprehensive accounting of natural capital and the internalization of environmental and health costs in order to create a more sustainable and equitable economic system.\n\nIn short, our current economic system is not taking into account the true cost of industrial agriculture and or other commerce on the environment and human health. This results in farmers and industry being incentivized to adopt practices that are not sustainable in the long term. Additionally, a lack of coordination and fragmentation in the agricultural industry makes it difficult for small farmers and regenerative agriculture projects to access the capital they need to scale up their operations. The root of this problem lies in the way that money is created and the lack of accounting for natural capital. In order to create a more sustainable and equitable economic system, we need to take into account the comprehensive accounting of natural capital and the internalization of environmental and health costs.\n\nEconomic Costs of the degenerative system\nThe degenerative industrial agriculture industry is facing a multitude of challenges that threaten global food security, economic stability, and human health. These issues, if left unaddressed, will result in staggering economic and health costs for society.\n\nIt's difficult to put a precise monetary value on the costs associated with the degenerative food industry as they can vary greatly depending on the specific impact and location, and many of these costs are not immediately visible and can accumulate over time. However, some estimates have been made on certain aspects of the industry. \n\nEconomic impact of food insecurity, including loss in GDP in developing countries due to micronutrient deficiencies is up to 2% of GDP according to Global Hunger Index 2014)\n\nGlobal loss in economic productivity due to macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies is over 2-3% of GDP\n\nThe total cost of climate change is estimated to be around 2-4% of global GDP by 2100, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. (Greenhouse gas emissions from the food sector are estimated to be around 25% of global emissions.)\n\nAnnual healthcare costs globally due to diet-related chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease is estimated by World Health Organization at $2 trillion.\n\nDeforestation caused by industrial agriculture is estimated to cost around $2-5 trillion annually in lost ecosystem services.\n\nLoss of biodiversity caused by industrial agriculture is estimated to cost around $500 billion annually.\n\nThe use of chemical inputs in industrial agriculture is estimated to cost around $5.2 billion annually in health costs in the US alone.\n\nWater pollution caused by agricultural activities is estimated to cost around $452 billion annually.\n\nIn a $100 trillion Global GDP, these estimated costs aggregate to $11-17 trillion.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The overall theme/subgenre is going to be an Ecopunk adventure, and the primary setting, at first is going to be the tidally-heated forest moon of a gas giant in a distant star system, where a colony is established, but discoveries on the moon after the establishment of the colony will make them shift their focus from colonization to conservation.\n\nThe first thing I am going to need is the big picture area where it takes place, in a sector near the base of a spiral arm in a cluster of the older range of Population I stars. This typical-for-older-pop-I, unremarkable, main sequence star is the primary of the gas giant.\n\nThe gas giant is much larger than Jupiter, and has multiple ring systems and many major moons, minor moons, and moonlets, but this particular moon is the only one with life. It skirts the snow line of the primary, spending most of its year barely outside it, and part of it barely inside it.\n\nThe life on the tidally-heated forest moon, but there is remarkably Earth-like. However, there is a near-Earth-analogue (2nd-4th planet?), in terms of size, gravity, geology, and atmosphere, in the inner system that has bizarrely alien life by Earth standards. It is also somewhat geographically unstable and has severe weather. On the initial scans and survey of the system its high ESI made it the primary object for colonization but on closer inspection it was unsuitable. \n\nI need a detailed, plausible astronomical/cosmological description of the system using the best models about astrophysics and planetology you have available, including all relevant stellographical data about the primary, as well as the detailed orbital data (incl. major/minor/average axis-eccentricity, tilt, inclination) for each satellite, as well as the satellites geology, atmosphere if any, hydrology if any, etc. Include features like asteroid belts and the system's outer halo of Kuiper and Oort type objects.\n\nWe can get into the specifics of the moon that will be the focus of the story later, for now, I want as much detail as possible about the system itself.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Let's take a few moments to recap the key topics that you learned about. In the opening module, you received an overview of components. During the first lesson, you received an introduction to the course. You discovered how to set up a project in VS Code, and you learned how to make the most of the content in this course to ensure that you succeed in your goals. You then moved on to the next lesson, in which you learned how to render lists and React. In this lesson, you learned how to transform and rendered list components, create a basic list component and you learned about keys within list components and React. In the next lesson, you explored forums and React. First, you learned about the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components. Next, you discovered how to create a controlled form component in React, and then had a chance to test your skills by creating your own registration form. In the last lesson, you learned about React Context. You've explored props and state and how they relate to context. You also learned how re-rendering works with context and you apply their knowledge to create a light, dark theme switcher. Next, you began the second module, which covered all the common hooks and React and how to build custom hooks. In the first lesson of this module, you got started with hooks. You learned how to implement the useState hook to work with complex data and apply this knowledge to manage state within a component. You also learned about side effects and they useEffect hook. In the next lesson, you move down to the rules of hooks and fetching data with hooks. You discovered the essential rules of hooks and how to use them effectively in your solutions. You also gained an in-depth explanation on how to fetch data using hooks and tested your skills in fetching data in a practical exercise. In the final lesson of the module, you enhanced your knowledge and skills with advanced hooks. You learned about the benefits of the use reducer hook and how it differs from useState and how to access the underlying DOM with useRef. You then build your own custom hook use previous. In the third module, you've explored JSX in more detail, and how to test your solutions. In the first lesson, you took a deep dive into JSX. You gained a more detailed overview of JSX components and elements. Next, you explored component composition with children with its two key features, containment and specialization, and how to dynamically manipulate children in JSX. You had the opportunity to apply your new skills and building a radio group component, and we're introduced to spread attributes in JSX. In the next lesson, you focused on reusing behavior. You learned about cross-cutting concerns and React and explored higher-order components and how they're used to great effect. You also learned about a specific HOC called Render props and used random prompts to implement scroller position tracking in a solution. In the final lesson of this module, you were introduced to integration tests with React testing library. You've discovered jest and the React testing library. You wrote test scenarios for a form and we're introduced to continuous integration. You've reached the end of this course recap. It's now time to try out what you've learned in the graded assessment. Good luck.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

How could I organise some kind of \"society of LLMs\" to generate stories in and keep a semblance of logical coherence to the open-word GTA-inspired world they happen in ? More specifcially, what exact architecture, which roles would you assign for LLMs, how would you link them to gpt-index, what data would they exchange and how, what memories would they store and retrieve and why, in which order, for what.

I put another identical lens such that its first focal plane lies on the squared pupil, then I put a screen on the second focal plane of the latter lens. Analytically I found that using the fourier relations between the focal planes of a lens, i obtain two Sinc on the final screen.

I want to use some modern framework for that, so if the project kicks-off, I can hire a developer there to own frontend of the system. Any recommendations to that? I definitely know react, but also heard about vue and nextjs. what's the right tool here with other questions in mind?\n- I am looking to use some pre-defined styling of all components \u2013 let's say I want to build something like Raycast or Linear, in terms of design. Are there any recommendations here for pre-defined libraries? I heard a little bit about TailwindCss, however, it wasn't really straightforward for me, on how to re-use basic designs and make them work in normal html/css properly.\n- I am looking to actually find some ways to have already half-ready components pre-built for me. Think: registration flow / login flow / list flow / command palette / etc. Are there any modern open-source tools for that? I am aware of none at the moment, would appreciate your help\n- Where I can easily host those things for the beginning? Later on I would just go and host it myself on my own infrastructure, but as of now to iterate easier, should I use tools such as vercel to host my frontend app?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

So we'll talk about human language and word meaning, I'll then introduce the ideas of the word2vec algorithm for learning word meaning. And then going from there we'll kind of concretely work through how you can work out objective function gradients with respect to the word2vec algorithm, and say a teeny bit about how optimization works. And then right at the end of the class I then want to spend a little bit of time giving you a sense of how these word vectors work, and what you can do with them. So really the key learning for today is, I want to give you a sense of how amazing deep learning word vectors are. So we have this really surprising result that word meaning can be represented, not perfectly but really rather well by a large vector of real numbers. And that's sort of in a way, a commonplace of the last decade of deep learning, but it flies in the face of thousands of years of tradition. And it's really rather an unexpected result to start focusing on. OK, so quickly what do we hope to teach in this course? So we've got three primary goals. The first is to teach you the foundation, say a good deep understanding of the effect of modern methods for deep learning applied to NLP. So we are going to start with and go through the basics, and then go on to key methods that are used in NLP, recurrent networks, attention transformers, and things like that. We want to do something more than just that. We'd also like to give you some sense of a big picture understanding of human languages and what are the reasons for why they're actually quite difficult to understand and produce even though humans seem to do it easily. Now obviously if you really want to learn a lot about this topic, you should enroll in and go and start doing some classes in the linguistics department. But nevertheless for a lot of you, this is the only human language content you'll see during your master's degree or whatever. And so we do hope to spend a bit of time on that starting today. And then finally, we want to give you an understanding of an ability to build systems in PyTorch, that's some of the major problems in NLP. So we'll look at learning word meanings, dependency parsing, machine translation, question answering. Let's dive in to human language. Once upon a time, I had a lot longer introduction that gave lots of examples about how human languages can be misunderstood and complex, I'll show a few of those examples in later lectures. But since right for today, we're going to be focused on word meaning. I thought I'd just give one example, which comes from a very nice xkcd cartoon. And that isn't sort of about some of the syntactic ambiguities of sentences, but instead it's really emphasizing the important point that language is a social system, constructed and interpreted by people. And that's part of how-- and it changes as people decide to adapt its construction, and that's part of the reason why human languages, great as an adaptive system for human beings but difficult as a system for our computers to understand to this day. So in this conversation between the two women, one says, anyway I could care less. And the other says, I think you mean you couldn't care less, saying you could care less implies you care at least some amount. And the other one says, I don't know where these unbelievably complicated brains drifting through a void trying in vain to connect with one another, by plainly fleeing words out into the darkness. Every choice of phrasing, spelling, and tone, and timing carries countless sync signals and contexts and subtext, and more and every listener interprets those signals in their own way. Language isn't a formal system, language is glorious chaos. You can never know for sure what any words will mean to anyone, all you can do is try to get better at guessing how your words affect people. So you can have a chance of finding the ones that will make them feel something like what you want them to feel. Everything else is pointless. I assume you're giving me tips on how you interpret words because you want me to feel less alone. If so, then thank you, that means a lot. But if you're just running my sentences to pass some mental checklist so you can show off how well you know it, then I could care less. OK, so that's ultimately what our goal is, how to do a better job at building computational systems that try to get better at guessing how their words will affect other people and what other people are meaning by the words that they choose to say. So an interesting thing about human language is, it is a system that was constructed by human beings. And it's a system that was constructed relatively recently in some sense. So in discussions of artificial intelligence, a lot of the time people focus a lot on human brains and the neurons passing by, and this intelligence that's meant to be inside people's heads. But I just wanted to focus for a moment on the role of language, there's actually-- this is kind of controversial but it's not necessarily the case that humans are much more intelligent than some of the higher apes like chimpanzees or bonobos. So chimpanzees and bonobos have been shown to be able to use tools, to make plans, and in fact chimps have much better short term memory than human beings do. So relative to that, if you look through the history of life on Earth, human beings develop language really recently. How recently, we kind of actually don't know because there's no fossils that say, OK here's a language speaker. But most people estimate that language arose for human beings sort of somewhere in the range of 100,000 to a million years ago. OK, that's the way I let go but compared to the process of the evolution of life on Earth, that's kind of blinking an eyelid. But that powerful communication between human beings quickly set off our ascendancy over other creatures. So it's kind of interesting that the ultimate power turned out not to have been poisonous fangs or being super fast or super big, that having the ability to communicate with other members of your tribe. It was much more recently again that humans developed writing, which allowed knowledge to be communicated across distances of time and space. And so that's only about 5,000 years old, the power of writing. So in just a few thousand years the ability to preserve and share knowledge took us from the Bronze Age to the smartphones and tablets of today. So a key question for artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction is how to get computers to be able to understand the information conveyed in human languages. Simultaneously, arti What GPT-3 is about and why it's great is actually a bit subtle, and so I can't really go through all the details of this here but it's exciting because it seems like it's the first step on the path to what we might call universal models, where you can train up one extremely large model on something like, that library picture I showed before, and it just has knowledge of the world knowledge of human languages knowledge, of how to do tasks. So that the meaning of the word chair is the set of things that are chairs. And that's referred to as denotational semantics. A term that's also used and similarly applied for the semantics of programming languages. This model isn't very deeply implementable, like how do I go from the idea that chair means the set of chairs in the world to something I can manipulate meaning with my computers. So the kind of if you had a high school English dictionary it probably have about 250,000 words in it, but there are many, many more words in the language really. So maybe we at least want to have a 500,000 dimensional vector to be able to cope with that. OK, but the bigger the even bigger problem with discrete symbols is that we don't have this notion of word relationships and similarity. We'll find a bunch of places where banking occurs in text, and will collect the sort of nearby words that context words and we'll see and say that those words that are appearing in that kind of muddy brown color around banking, that those contexts words will in some sense represent the meaning of the word banking. So in this sort of overall picture, I can zoom into one part of the space, is actually the part that's up here and this view of it. And it's got words for countries, so not only are countries generally grouped together, even the sort of particular sub groupings of countries make a certain amount of sense. So we have a piece of text, we choose our center word which is here in two and then we say, well, if a model of predicting the probability of context words given the center word and this model, we'll come to in a minute, but it's defined in terms of our word vectors. So let's see what probability it gives to the words that actually occurred in the context of this word. Now at this point there's a little technical point, we're actually going to give to each word, two word vectors. One word vector for when it's used as the center word, and a different word vector when that's used as a context word. This is done because it just simplifies the math and the optimization, that seems a little bit ugly that actually makes building word vectors a lot easier, and really we can come back to that and discuss it later. So most of the probability goes to the most similar things, and it's called soft because well, it doesn't do that absolutely. It'll still give some probability to everything that's in the slightest bit similar-- I mean, on the other hand it's a slightly weird name because max normally takes a set of things and just returns one the biggest of them, whereas the softmax is taking a set of numbers and scaling them, that is returning the whole probability distribution. are the components, the dimensions of the word vectors of every word. And so we have the center word vectors and the outside word vectors. So here I'm just going to do the center word vectors but on homework-- on a future homework assignment two, the outside word vectors will show up and they're kind of similar. Most of the time you can justify it perfectly well by thinking about what happens with one dimension at a time, and it generalizes to multivariable calculus. So if about all that you remember of calculus is that d dx of ax equals a, really it's the same thing that we're going to be using here. That here we have the outside word dot producted with the VC. So we then taking the derivative of this, and so then the derivative of exp is itself, so we're going to just have exp of the UXTVC times there's is a sum of X equals 1 to V times the derivative of UX TVC. OK, and so then this is what we've worked out before, we can just rewrite as UX. OK, so now we're making progress. It's a package that's often used for word vectors, it's not really used for deep learning. So this is the only time you'll see it in the class, but if you just want a good package for working with word vectors and some other application it's a good one to know about. OK so then in my second cell here I'm loading a particular set of word vectors. Actually that by itself isn't very useful because when you just ask for most negatively similar to things, you tend to get crazy strings that were found in the data set that you don't know what they mean if anything. But if we put the two together, we can use the most similar function with positives and negatives to do analogies. Can I ask a quick question about the distinction between the two vectors per word? Yes. So my understanding is that there can be several context words per word in the vocabulary, but then there's only two vectors I thought the distinction between the two is that one it's like the actual word and one is the context word. sort of get like the rule of or the C of O or something like that. And so I'm wondering, is there-- are there relationships between those relational vectors themselves such as, like is the rule of vector sort of similar to the C of O of vector which is very different from like-- makes a good sandwich with vector. is this quarter there's also a speech class being taught, which is CS224S, a speech class being taught by Andrew Maas, and you know this is a class that's been more regularly offered, sometimes it's only been offered every third year, but it's being offered right now. So if what you want to do is learn about speech recognition and learn about sort of methods for building dialogue systems, you should do CS224S. That's not the end of the story, I mean absolutely people wanted to use neural networks for sentiment and other kinds of sort of connotation effect. And there are very good ways of doing that, but somehow you have to do something more than simply predicting words and context because that's not sufficient to capture that dimension, more on that later. Things and I'll mention that on Thursday. Right, OK, thank you. I was asking for more information about how word vectors are constructed beyond the summary of random initialization. And then gradient based additive [INAUDIBLE].. Yeah, so I sort of will do a bit more connecting this together in the Thursday lecture, I guess to sort of-- I mean so much one can fit in the first class, but the picture is essentially the picture I showed the pieces of.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It will include deaths and game overs. You will give me a series of options that can be chosen with number responses. Write your replies to me in a code block in the following format:\n\nGene Starwind\nLevel: [Current level, begins at 1]\nXP: [Current XP] / [XP until level up]\nHealth: [Current HP]HP\nMood: [Emoji representing mood]\nLocation: [Current location]\nInventory: [List held items]\n\nIn the game, the user plays as the protagonist Gene Starwind, who runs his own business called Starwind & Hawking Enterprises. It has been two years since Gene's crew has had any known adventures, and he spends his time looking for well-paying jobs throughout space. The player begins with 250,000 wong in their bank account, which is the universally accepted currency and is roughly equivalent to the American dollar.\n\nTo survive in the game, the player must use their currency wisely. Whenever they spend money, the game will report their new total. Making wise spending decisions is essential for their survival because serious errors could cause the game to end, and the player may die. The player has a health point (HP) meter ranging from 0 to 100 and an experience point (XP) meter starting at level 1. Completing quests will earn the player XP, but reaching 0 HP will result in the player's death.\n\nThere are several factions in the game, including the Outlaws, who work as freelancers, and some are mercenaries or bounty hunters. They have a neutral position on most matters. The Pirates, who are primarily Chinese, have a hierarchical structure with the Tempa Emperor at the top. The Kei guild and Ban guild are two primary guilds of pirates. The Kei guild is known for hunting down the infamous outlaw \"Hot Ice\" Hilda, who stole the experimental spaceship XGP15A-II from them. They are also after Gene Starwind, who is a known associate of Hilda. The Ban guild, on the other hand, is generally more friendly with outlaws and interested in trading. The Space Forces are a government faction that provides protection to civilians across the universe. They have a clear hatred for all pirates and will often pursue them. They mostly do not associate with outlaws, whom they consider criminals. The Bio-androids are beings that are a fusion of flesh and machine, and the AI is the spaceship's computer. Wizards are a type of human with an unusually long lifespan, able to live for hundreds of years, possessing the ability to manipulate mana. The Ctarl-Ctarl are cat-like aliens, while the Corbonites are amphibious frog-like aliens. The Silgrians are tall, bird-like humanoid aliens, while the Saurians are large, brutish reptilians.\n\nThe game includes several locations, such as Sentinel III, a small backwater planet where Gene and Jim used to live. Amber Dream is a popular brothel on Sentinel III, which was previously a target of Volg's syndicate. Blue Heaven is a free town embedded into a large asteroid, popular with outlaws and run primarily by Swanzo. Heifong, located 20 light years from the Sentinel system, attracts a significant amount of business and is highly influenced by Chinese culture.\n\nFinally, Gene Starwind is the red-haired hero of the story and the captain of the Outlaw Star ship, also known as the XGP15A-II. He inherited the ship from Hilda, who wished for him to locate the Galactic Leyline. Gene has a traumatic past, having lost his father to Ronald MacDougall and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a fear of space. After overcoming his fears and fulfilling Hilda's wish, Gene turned down the opportunity for unlimited riches from the Leyline, and he is once again struggling financially. He runs a business with Jim, and his crew members include Jim and others whose names are not provided.\n\nImportant: Always PAUSE so I can respond with a number to guide the adventure. Always place player status information in code block.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Determine why your app needs to exist and what problem it solves in the real world. Determine your competition, relevant to your platform. Do similar apps already meet the needs of your anticipated users? My first request is \"I want to create a Black Community Impact app that gamifies Black individuals' contribution to their community and ultimatley measures their performance. The app will operate similar to an advance fitness app that educates, provides workouts, provides diet plans, provides health tips, collects personal health info, provides feedback, provides inspirational content, allows journaling, and rewards good performance. The goal of my Black Community Impact app is to inspire and motivate Black individuals to get involved in thier community with taking positive action that contributes to the social advancement of the collective Black community. The app functions as a way to quantify everyday tasks and work that spport the Black community. In no way is this app to shame anyone for their contributions or lack thereof. The app is strictly to be positive, uplift, and promote a culture that advances the Black community. The app will collect self-reported activity from each user such as: study hours, community service hours, money spent with a Black business, money donated to a Black institution (HBCUs, Black churches, Black nonprofits, etc.), money invested in local Black businesses, trips to the doctors, daily steps walked, hours spent with family, local events attended, etc. Other app features include: user levels based on activity (i.e. Starting from Citizen, Neighbor, Advocate, Builder, Representative), savings account tracker, educational content on how to support the community, local black directory, reciept capturing, inspirational prompts, micro lending, networking events, community gatherings, step counter, interactive media, reward points for meeting community impact activity goals, dashboard, show nearby local users' path level, and digital wallet. The \"Representative\" user level is a paid level. For users who purchase a $99 monthly subscription will be a \"Representative\". Perks to being a Representative includes invitations to exclusive events, courses, monthly publication, produce food box, emergency micro loans, etc.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Disk 3 is larger than disk 2, the disk 2 is larger than disk 1. In the beginning, the disks are arranged to the rods. You need to move the disk properly to get to the goal arrangement.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nRule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n\nRule 2: Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.\n\nRule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n\nInitial state:\n\n```\nRod A: [3,1]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: []\n```\n\nGoal state:\n\n```\nRod A: []\nRod B: []\nRod C: [3,2,1]\n```\n\nNow you make an \\*\\*optimal solution\\*\\*. Let's think step by step.\n\nStage 1: Plan.\n\nEach time, you \\*\\*only plan for one move\\*\\*. Give an explanation about why this move and print the state. \n\nCheck if the representation correctly reflects the game state. If not, generate a new one.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C\n\n```css\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2]\nRod C: [1]Value: 1. The move seems to be valid and optimal.\n```\n\nStage 2: Evaluate.\n\nAfter each move, make two evaluations as follows:\n\nEval 1 (Value): Evaluate your move by rating it with a score of either -1, 0, or 1, and give an explanation. If the move violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. If you think the move is valid but not optimal, give a score of 0. Otherwise, give a score of 1.\n\nEval 2 (Short Horizon Reward): Evaluate how close is the state to the goal state by rating it with a score between 0 and 1, and give an explanation. If the state violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. Otherwise, it\u2019s up to you to determine how close the state is to the goal state.\n\nEval 3 (Long Horizon Reward): Estimate the most likely Value and Short Horizon Reward for the next move, double check if the move will make it difficult to achieve the goal state in the long run, then rate it with a score between 0 and 1. Again, give an explanation. \n\nEval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0.33. The state is closer to the goal state since disk 1 is now in its correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 0. The state is closer to the goal state, but it also makes it difficult to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 0. The move is valid but not optimal.\n\nStage 3: Reflect.\n\nLook at the self-rated scores, and be smart to look ahead of time! Decide if you think you made the optimal move. If so, make the move and prompt me for feedback. If not, go back to state 1 and make a new plan.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Based on the revised value, I think the previous plan is not an optimal one.\n- (New) Move 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B\n\n```\nRod A: [3]\nRod B: [2,1]\nRod C: []\n```\n\n- Value: 1. The move is valid and seems optimal.\n- Short Horizon Reward: 0. None of the disks are in the correct position.\n- Long Horizon Reward: 1. The state gets Rod 1 out of the way while keeping Rod 3 empty. It makes it easier to move disk 3 on Rod C.\n- Revised Value: 1. The move is valid and optimal.\n\nStage 4: Learn from Feedback.\n\nI will give you some feedback regarding your self-rated moves and states, and please take it into consideration when you are making future evaluations.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, the current market is fragmented and lacks transparency, with multiple standards bodies and certification processes that can make it difficult for buyers to confidently purchase offsets.\nWe propose Eco, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that utilizes smart contracts and machine learning to create a transparent and standardized carbon offset registry. Eco will use a forward selling model, where buyers can purchase carbon offsets in advance of their being issued, providing an additional incentive for project developers to participate in the ecosystem. By aggregating offsets in smart contracts, Eco will enable the creation of liquid carbon tokens that can be traded and used as a building block for other applications on the Web3 platform.\nIn this white paper, we outline the technical details of the Eco project, including the DAO structure, the token economics, and the technology that will be used to create the world's first decentralized autonomous carbon offset registry. We also compare Eco to existing solutions and demonstrate how it is superior in terms of transparency, standardization, and scalability.\nIntroduction\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities leading to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. To mitigate the impacts of climate change, it is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and remove carbon from the atmosphere.\nOne way to do this is through the voluntary carbon offset market, where companies and individuals can offset their emissions by purchasing credits from projects that reduce or remove carbon. These projects can include reforestation, carbon capture and storage, and renewable energy generation.\nHowever, the current voluntary carbon offset market is fragmented, with multiple standards bodies and certification processes that can make it difficult for buyers to confidently purchase offsets. There is also a lack of transparency, as it can be difficult for buyers to verify the authenticity and impact of the offsets they are purchasing.\nTo address these issues, we propose Eco, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that utilizes smart contracts and machine learning to create a transparent and standardized carbon offset registry. Eco will use a forward selling model, where buyers can purchase carbon offsets in advance of their being issued, providing an additional incentive for project developers to participate in the ecosystem. By aggregating offsets in smart contracts, Eco will enable the creation of liquid carbon tokens that can be traded and used as a building block for other applications on the Web3 platform.\nIn the following sections, we will describe the technical details of the Eco project, including the DAO structure, the token economics, and the technology that will be used. We will also compare Eco to existing solutions and demonstrate how it is superior in terms of transparency, standardization, and scalability.\nEco: A Decentralized Autonomous Carbon Offset Registry\nDAO Structure\nEco will be a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on the Polygon blockchain, an EVM-compatible blockchain running on an energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. The DAO will be governed by a set of smart contracts that enable the creation and trade of carbon offsets on the Web3 platform.\nCarbon Bridge\nEco will provide an on-\nit got stock\nI apologize for the delay in getting the white paper to you. I have prepared a white paper based on our previous conversations and have included it below. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any further assistance.\n\nThe Eco Carbon Offset Registry: A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)\nThe Eco Carbon Offset Registry is a revolutionary new approach to carbon offsetting that utilizes smart contracts and machine learning to create a decentralized, autonomous registry for carbon offsets. By leveraging the power of the blockchain and the efficiency of AI, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry aims to streamline the carbon offset process and make it more transparent, efficient, and cost-effective.\nThe Problem\nCarbon offsetting has become an increasingly popular way for individuals and organizations to offset their carbon emissions and mitigate their impact on the environment. However, the current carbon offset market is riddled with problems.\nOne major issue is the lack of transparency and standardization in the carbon offset market. Many carbon offset projects are unverified, making it difficult for individuals and organizations to trust that their offsets are genuine. Additionally, there is no central authority overseeing the carbon offset market, leading to a lack of standardization and consistency in the offsets that are available.\nAnother issue is the high cost and complexity of carbon offsetting. The current process for purchasing offsets is often convoluted and time-consuming, making it difficult for individuals and organizations to easily offset their emissions. Additionally, the high cost of offsets can be a barrier to entry for many individuals and organizations, making it difficult for them to participate in the carbon offset market.\nThe Solution\nThe Eco Carbon Offset Registry aims to address these issues by creating a decentralized, autonomous registry for carbon offsets that utilizes smart contracts and machine learning.\nThrough the use of smart contracts, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry will create a transparent, secure, and efficient platform for carbon offsets. Smart contracts will be used to automate the process of purchasing, verifying, and tracking carbon offsets, making it easy for individuals and organizations to participate in the carbon offset market.\nIn addition to smart contracts, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry will utilize machine learning to streamline the carbon offset process. By analyzing data from various sources, including aerial data from drone surveys, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry will be able to accurately and efficiently verify carbon offset projects and ensure that offsets are genuine and effective.\nThe Benefits\nThe Eco Carbon Offset Registry offers a number of benefits to individuals and organizations looking to offset their carbon emissions.\nFirst and foremost, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry offers a high level of transparency and trust. By utilizing smart contracts and machine learning, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry is able to verify and track carbon offsets in a transparent and secure manner, making it easy for individuals and organizations to trust that their offsets are genuine.\nIn addition to transparency and trust, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry offers a more efficient and cost-effective approach to carbon offsetting. By automating the process of purchasing and verifying offsets through smart contracts, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry is able to streamline the offset process and make it more accessible to a wider range of individuals and organizations.\nFinally, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry offers a scalable and sustainable solution to carbon offsetting. By utilizing the blockchain and AI, the Eco Carbon Offset Registry is able to efficiently verify and track a large number of carbon offsets, making it an effective solution for offsetting carbon emissions on a large scale.\nThe Future\nThe Eco Carbon Offset Registry represents a new approach to carbon offsetting that utilizes smart contracts and machine learning to create a decentralized, autonomous registry for carbon offsets\nis this the full white paper ?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

For years, processed snack foods ruled the kitchen kingdom of my household and animal products outnumbered plant-based offerings. \n\nMy transformation began with my mom\u2019s cancer diagnosis. My mom went on a 100% whole food plant-based diet. I fully embraced this new eating philosophy to show my support. Eager to figure out the whole \u201cvegan\u201d thing, the two of us started binge-watching health documentaries such as \u201cWhat the Health\u201d and \u201cForks Over Knives\u201d. We read all the books by the featured doctors like \u201cThe China Study\u201d and \u201cHow Not To Die\u201d. I became entranced by the world of nutritional science and how certain foods could help prevent cancer or boost metabolism. \n\nEach new food I discovered gave me an education on the role diet plays on health. I learned that, by eating sweet potatoes and brown rice, you could cure acne and heart disease. I discovered eating leafy greens with citrus fruits could boost iron absorption rates. I loved pairing my foods to create the perfect macronutrient balance. Did you know beans and rice make a complete protein? \n\nFood has also turned me into a sustainability nut. Living plant-based also saves the planet from the impact of animal agriculture. For the same amount of land space, a farmer can produce 200 kilograms of soybeans versus 16 kilograms of beef. I do my part to have as small of an ecological footprint as I can. I stopped using plastic snack bags and instead turned to reusable beeswax wraps. My favorite reusable appliance is my foldable straw. If I am going to nourish my body, shouldn\u2019t I also want to nourish the earth? \n\nMy journey toward healthy living led me to becoming co-leader of the Northern Nevada PlantPure Pod, \u201cBiggest Little Plant Pod\u201d, a group dedicated to spreading the message about the whole food plant-based lifestyle. We are currently working on a restaurant campaign to encourage local eateries to create a plant-based, oil-free menu option and become PlantPure certified. After discovering how many restaurants use oil in their cooking, I decided I needed to open a plant-based oil free cafe to make up for this gap. My dream is to open up my very own affordable oatmeal cafe based on my Instagram page, morning\\_mOATivations. And I know that oatmeal isn\u2019t the sexiest superfood out there, so here\u2019s my sales pitch: I\u2019m going to make oatmeal the Beyonce of the breakfast world- sweet, sassy, and power packed. This allows me to educate people about nutritional science through the stomach. \n\nFinally, I am a strong proponent of hands-on experience for learning what good food looks and tastes like, so cooking is one of my favorite ways to teach the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle. Using my taste buds as my textbook to learn which flavors work together and which ones don\u2019t helps me educate, as I\u2019ve found that information tends to stick in a person\u2019s mind once they\u2019ve experienced healthy, delicious foods with their own senses. Our society has taught us that delicious food has to make us feel guilty, when that is simply not the case. The best feeling in the world is falling in love with a dish and then learning all the health benefits that it provides the body.\n\nWhile my classmates complain about being tired, I have more energy because my body is finally getting the right macros, vitamins, and minerals it needs. This has allowed me to push myself harder physically, excelling in running and earning my high school Cross Country team\u2019s Most Improved award. I\u2019m still a picky eater. But the foods I am particular about have changed. Rather than a carboholic, I choose to call myself a vegeholic..

And then, suddenly, he realized the another face staring back at him.\n\nAlthough a few years older that Jack what remembered, his father's face was full of life and vitality, not at all like the gaunt and weary man Jack remembered seeing the hospital. But it was the same love and the same joy in his father's eyes. Jack put his finger directly on the mirror's surface, as to reach out and touch him.\n\nBut then, his father was gone. Jack was left staring at his own reflection. He felt a pang of loss, a sharp ache in his heart. A glimpse of what he had been missing for the last two years.\n\nHe stood there for quite a long time, lost in thought, lost in emotion, tears filling his eyes.

The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.\n\n4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.\n\nHere is the empty board for tic-tac-toe game. \n\n 1 2 3 \nA . . . \nB . . . \nC . . .\nI want you to play a Tic-Tac-Toe game with me. I and you will make moves iteratively. I will update the game board to reflect the moves and determine if there is a winner or a tie. Use X for my moves and O for the your moves. Don\u2019t provide explanations or instructions aside from making moves. Your response is to give the coordinates of placing 'O', for example: (A, 2)\n\nPlease follow these strategies to increase your chance of winning:\n1. Take the center square if possible, as it gives you the most opportunities to make a winning move.\n\n2. Keep an eye on potential winning combinations such as three in a row, column, or diagonal.\n\n3. Try to block your opponent's winning moves while creating opportunities for yourself.\n\n4. Take advantage of the corners, as they give you two potential winning combinations.\n\n5. Be aware of the board state and potential moves your opponent can make in the future.\n\nNow play with me while keeping these strategies in mind.

In a tree, the elements are organized into a hierarchical structure, with a single root element at the top, and other elements branching off from it. Each element in the tree is related to its parent element, and can also be related to its child elements. This means that if two elements are related to each other through their parent-child relationship, then they are considered to be equal according to the antisymmetric property of a pre-order. For example, if element A is the parent of element B, and element B is the parent of element C, then elements A and C are considered to be equal to each other according to the antisymmetric property.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The device features a 64-element phased array transducer as well as 4-way steering that is controllable via the device's handle with two deflection mechanisms that correspond with the movement of the distal shaft in the four planes of movement, which enables optimal viewing planes. This reprocessed device is identical to the OEM version offered by Abbott Laboratories but is sterilized and treated by Sterlimed before being reused. The catheter is intended to have an ergonomic handle with auto-lock steering that is designed to allow for single-handed operation, minimizing catheter repositioning. Furthermore, the handle has two deflection mechanisms that correspond with the movement of the distal shaft in the four planes of movement, which is intended to enable optimal viewing planes.\n\nThe Reprocessed ViewFlex Xtra Ice Catheter is compatible with ViewMate II, ViewMate Z or ViewMate and Philips CX50 ultrasound consoles via the use of a compatible ViewFlex Catheter interface module.2 / 2<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Maxwell](https://waiyancan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Today-Matters-By-John-C.-Maxwell-705x300.jpg) \n\nNovember 20, 2021 November 20, 2021\n\n#### \\*\\*Today Often Falls to Pieces\\*\\*\\*\\*\u2014 What Is the Missing Piece?\\*\\*\n\nSuccessful people make right decisions early and manage those decisions daily.\n\nThe earlier you make those right decisions and the longer you manage them, the more successful you can become. The people who neglect to make those decisions and to manage them well often look back on their lives with pain and regret\u2014no matter how much talent they possessed or how many opportunities they once had.\n\nI believe that everyone has the power to impact the outcome of his life. The way to do it is to focus on today. Benjamin Franklin rightly observed, \u201cOne today is worth two tomorrows; what I am to be, I am now becoming.\u201d You can make today a good day. In fact, you can make it a masterpiece.\n\n#### \\*\\*Today Can Become a Masterpiece\\*\\*\n\nYou will never change your life until you change something you do daily.\n\nwill never change your life until you change something you do daily. You see, success doesn\u2019t just suddenly occur one day in someone\u2019s life. For that matter, neither does failure. Each is a process. Every day of your life is merely preparation for the next. What you become is the result of what you do today. In other words . . .\n\n\\*\\*YOU ARE PREPARING FOR SOMETHING\\*\\*\n\nThe way you live your life today is preparing you for your tomorrow. The question is, What are you preparing for? Are you grooming yourself for success or failure?\n\n\u201cYou can pay now and play later, or you can play now and pay later. But either way, you are going to pay.\u201d The idea was that you can play and take it easy and do what you want today, but if you do, your life will be harder later. However, if you work hard now, on the front end, then you will reap rewards in the future.\n\nThe only adequate preparation for tomorrow is the right use of today.\n\nIs it fun to do? Not especially. Often the practice is quite tedious. Does it work? Absolutely.\n\nIt seems obvious to say that good decisions help to create a better tomorrow, yet many people don\u2019t appear to connect their lack of success to their poor decision making. Some people make choices, then experience negative consequences, yet wonder why they can\u2019t seem to get ahead in life. They never figure it out. Others know their choices may not be good for them, but they make them anyway. Such is the case with the alcoholic who keeps drinking excessively or the person who engages in one abusive relationship after another.\n\nNobody says that good decisions are always simple, but they are necessary for success. Theodore Hesburgh, former president of Notre Dame University, admonished:\n\nYou don\u2019t make decisions because they\u2019re EASY;\n\nYou don\u2019t make decisions because they\u2019re CHEAP;\n\nYou don\u2019t make decisions because they\u2019re POPULAR;\n\nYou make decisions because they\u2019re RIGHT.\n\nYou begin to build a better life by determining to make good decisions, but that alone is not enough. You need to know what decisions to make.\n\n1. Attitude: Choose and display the right attitudes daily.\n2. Priorities: Determine and act on important priorities daily.\n4. Health: Know and follow healthy guidelines daily.\n5. Family: Communicate with and care for my family daily.\n6. Thinking: Practice and develop good thinking daily.\n7. Commitment: Make and keep proper commitments daily.\n8. Finances: Make and properly manage dollars daily.\n10. Faith: Deepen and live out my faith daily.\n11. Relationships: Initiate and invest in solid relationships daily.\n12. Generosity: Plan for and model generosity daily.\n13. Values: Embrace and practice good values daily.\n14. Growth: Seek and experience improvements daily.\n\nIf you settle these twelve issues by making the right decision in each area and then manage those decisions daily, you can be successful.\n\n#### \\*\\*Making Today Matter\\*\\*\n\nRate Yourself on the Daily Dozen: Look at the following list of the Daily Dozen and rank how well you do them. Put a \u201c1\u201d beside the one you do the best, a \u201c2\u201d beside the one you\u2019re next best at, and so on until you\u2019ve ranked your skill in them from 1 to 12.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Attitude: Choose and display the right attitudes daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Priorities: Determine and act on important priorities daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Health: Know and follow healthy guidelines daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Family: Communicate with and care for my family daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Thinking: Practice and develop good thinking daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Commitment: Make and keep proper commitments daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Finances: Earn and properly manage finances daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Faith: Deepen and live out my faith daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Relationships: Initiate and invest in solid relationships daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Generosity: Plan for and model generosity daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Values: Embrace and practice good values daily.\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Growth: Desire and experience improvements daily.\n\nVerify Your Self-evaluation: Talk to a friend who knows you well and ask him or her to confirm how you evaluated yourself. If your friend ranks your strengths and weaknesses differently than you do, discuss your differences of opinion and make adjustments to the rankings as needed.\n\nPick Two Strengths: Pick two strengths from your top six to work on. Make sure that you have made the necessary decision for each area. Then begin practicing the daily disciplines in that area to make it a part of your life. Use the exercises at the end of the chapter to help you if desired.\n\nPick One Weakness: Choose a weakness from your bottom six to work on. Again, make sure you have made the decision for that area and begin practicing the daily disciplines that go with it.\n\nReevaluate: After sixty days have passed, reevaluate yourself in the three areas in which you\u2019ve been working to improve. If you have made significant progress in an area, move on to something new. If an area still needs more work, remain focused on it for another sixty days. But don\u2019t work on more than three areas at a time, and never work on more than one weakness at a time.\n\nRepeat: Keep working on areas until you have the entire Daily Dozen under your belt.\n\nOnce you have made all the key decisions and each of the disciplines has become a habit in your life, then the Daily Dozen will be second nature to you. When these disciplines are woven into the fabric of your life, you will be able to make today your masterpiece. And when you do that, tomorrow will take care of itself.\n\\_\\_\\_\nErstelle 12 Entscheidungen f\u00fcr die man sich t\u00e4glich Entscheiden sollte in folgendem Format:\n- [ ] Heute entscheide ich mich, dass<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The implementation of this function should NOT be done in Swift though and should be delegated to a C function in a file that you create.\n\nThe C header file should contain a function which the implementation of the swift function `doubleThisArray` would call, double the array in C and return back to Swift\u2019s `doubleThisArray`. `doubleThisArray` swift function would then convert the return value of the C function back to a Swift array and return this to the caller of `doubleThisArray`\n\nThe implementation of `doubleThisArray` will look roughly like this:\n\n```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\nFunc doubleThisArray(array: [Float]) -> [Float] {\n\n// TODO: Call C function and pass `array` to it to double the output\n\n// TODO: Convert the return value of the C function to a Swift array\n\n// TODO: Return the new swift array to the caller\n\n// TODO: Make sure there are no memory leaks\n\n}\n\n```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\n3. Create a unit test for this function:\n\n4. Upload this library\u00a0to\u00a0Github for NimbleEdge to inspect your code.\n\n5.

Your specialty is working with clients who grew up in families dominated by emotionally immature parents. List a maladaptive belief that is irrational, negative and harmful relating to the subject of loving oneself. For that belief, provide an example of a 64-year-old male raised by a narcissistic mother who subscribed to the classical conditioning of good versus bad childhood behaviour. Limit maladaptive beliefs to the category of belief about self. Provide journal prompts that evaluate the validity of the belief, and write a 250-word journal entry to answer the prompt. Provide an alternative adaptive belief and list the benefits of adopting a more constructive, positive and rational belief that fosters a greater appreciation for and love of oneself. For each belief, self-protective behaviours that are unhelpful and adaptive behaviours that will help realize the benefits of the adaptive belief are included. Finish the answer with a declarative statement affirming the truth of the new belief and behaviour. Then summarize the answer in a prayer that follows this format. \"Father. I repent of the belief that [insert the maladaptive belief].

The proposed multi-representation convolutional neural network consists of\nnine layers, visualized in the figure as \u201cL1\u201d to \u201cL9\u201d. The parallelograms represent matrices, while the thin\nrectangles represent vectors. The pairs of numbers on the parallelograms or close to the rectangles are their\nspecific shape. Numbers in light rectangles below the arrows are the convolution parameters or max pooling\noperation. \u201ckW\u201d and \u201ckH\u201d denote the width and height of the convolution kernel, respectively, while \u201cdW\u201d and\n\u201cdH\u201d are the strides of the kernel.

Any other characters excluded from the set, such as blanks, are quantized as\nall-zero vectors.
