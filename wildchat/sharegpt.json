          "response": "You can use the `CarbonImmutable::parse()` method with timezone information by passing the timezone as the second argument to the method. Here's an example:\n```php\n$dateString = '2022-04-01 12:00:00';\n$timezone = 'America/New_York';\n\n$date = CarbonImmutable::parse($dateString, $timezone);\n\necho $date->format('Y-m-d H:i:s T'); // Output: 2022-04-01 12:00:00 EDT\n```\nIn this example, we first define a `$dateString` variable containing a string representation of a date and time. We then define a `$timezone` variable containing the timezone information (in this case, \"America/New\\_York\").\n\nWe pass both of these variables as arguments to the `CarbonImmutable::parse()` method, with the `$dateString` as the first argument and `$timezone` as the second argument.\n\nThe `parse()` method will then create a new `CarbonImmutable` instance representing the date and time in the specified timezone.\n\nFinally, we use the `format()` method to output the date and time in the desired format, including the timezone information (in this case, \"EDT\").",

Put together words that inspire action and make people feel empowered to do something beyond their abilities.

My first request is \u201cI need a speech about how everyone should never give up.\n\nPlease write in English language.\n \n \n \n \uc9c0\uae08 \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\uae30<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
          "response": "Absolutely! Here's a motivational speech about never giving up:\n\nDear friends,\n\nI want to talk to you today about something that I believe is essential for achieving success in any area of life: never giving up. Life can be tough at times, and it's easy to feel like giving up when things don't go as planned. But I want to encourage you today to keep pushing forward, no matter what obstacles you face.\n\nThe truth is that every successful person has faced setbacks and failures. But what sets them apart from others is that they never gave up. They kept going, even when it seemed like there was no hope. They were determined to achieve their goals, and they didn't let anything get in their way.\n\nSo, what can you do to never give up? First, it's essential to have a clear vision of what you want to achieve. Whether it's a career goal, a personal dream, or a health and fitness goal, you need to have a clear picture of where you want to go.\n\nNext, you need to be willing to put in the work. Success rarely comes overnight, and you need to be willing to work hard and make sacrifices to achieve your goals. But the good news is that every step you take towards your goal brings you one step closer to success.\n\nAnd finally, you need to believe in yourself. Self-doubt can be a significant obstacle to achieving your goals, but you need to remember that you are capable of more than you think. Believe in your abilities and your potential, and never let anyone else's doubts or negativity bring you down.\n\nRemember, never giving up doesn't mean that you won't face challenges or setbacks. It means that you are committed to your goals and are willing to keep going, even when things get tough.\n\nSo, my friends, I encourage you today to never give up on your dreams. Keep pushing forward, and know that with hard work, determination, and belief in yourself, anything is possible.\n\nThank you.",
