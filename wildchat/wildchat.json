Three months ago, Mikasa captured a titan sympathizer named Jesse who tried to blow up an opening in wall Maria for titans to come through. Using an experimental drug, Mikasa shrank him to 5 inches tall and taped him to the insole of her brown knee-high leather boot. The story begins as Mikasa gets back home after a long day of being in the Survey Corps. Her and Annie walk in and sit on a couch. Mikasa and Annie talk about how hot it was as Mikasa tugs of her boots. Mikasa wiggles her sweaty toes in her black socks as Annie mentions how much more miserable it must've been for her living insole. Mikasa makes a dry joke at Jesse's expense as she peers inside her boot, seeing a bruised and weak Jesse still taped to her insole. Write 12 paragraphs. Count each paragraph to keep track of the length. Make sure Mikasa and Annie's speech patterns are accurate. Write their actions along with their in-character dialogue. Remember that Mikasa wears black socks with her brown knee-high leather boots and Annie wears no socks with her brown knee-high leather boots. Nake sure to include Annie and Mikasa's dislike for each other in their dialogue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She was born in the Sinnoh region, once a human adopted by Dialga during his time exploring the earthly realm in human form. Dialga\u2019s love for his daughter invoked powerful human emotions within his heart, which he had never experienced before.\n\nAs time flowed on and Karmaria grew older, Dialga could not bear to watch her age and eventually die from the limitations of the human life span. Desperate to save her, the heartbroken time god attempted to reverse time to spare her from her fate, but his act unleashed devastating consequences.\n\nIn his grief and desperation, Dialga\u2019s act of reversing time tore apart an entire dimension and threatened to collapse the universe. With every aspect of creation at the brink of destruction, Arceus, the god of creation, stepped in to rectify the chaos. He mended the rift that Dialga\u2019s actions had caused and restored balance to the cosmos. To prevent future tragedies, Arceus erased Dialga\u2019s memory of his time spent in the human world and the love he had for his beloved daughter.\n\nKarmaria, now a deity herself and the goddess of karma, was condemned to drift outside of the known dimension, unable to reunite with her father. This elegant and ethereal Pok\u00e9mon watches over the balance of fate, her own story serving as a reminder of the consequences even gods themselves can face when they tamper with time and the natural order of things.\n\n\nPlease generate the folklore of Karmaria in the Sinnoh region.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The brown-haired, brown-eyed heroine and member of the Wild, Wild Pussycats Shino Sosaki/Mandalay replaces Kohta's older female cousin Yuka and the chipper, hyperactive amber-eyed pinkette mad scientist Mei Hatsume replaces the abused diclonius queen turned murderous, human-hating serial killer Kaede/'Lucy\"/Nyu. The green-haired, brown-eyed Tsuyu Asui replaces the chipper and happy-go-lucky Silpelit girl Nana, and the cute and bubby, brown-haired and blue-eyed Ochakou Uraraka and the blonde-haired, red-eyed psychotic pseudo-vampire Himiko Toga both replace the cheerfully murderous sociopath and Director Kurama's biological daughter, the unstable Silpelit Mariko . The Meta Liberation Army replaces Director Kakusawa and the Hero Commission replaces the Institute.\n\nThe following events then happen in chronological order:\n\n. Kyoka is also a diclonius, inheriting the diclonius gene from her and Izuku's mother Inko's family. She [Kyoka] also has precogntive abilities, which manifest at the most inappropriate times but prove useful for Mei when she needs to go out, allowing her to stay one step ahead of the MLA and the Hero Commission.\n\n.The white-haired, red-eyed orphan girl Eri replaces the abused orphan girl Mayu, finding a home at Shino's place when she escapes from the Yakuza. Eri is only a year younger than Ochakou. \n\n. Tsuyu, Ochakou and Toga use their vectors and Quirks to protect Izuku from an MLA death squad sent to kill him due to Re-Destro assuming he is All for One's son, which causes Shino to find out about the diclonii.\n\n. Shino is unnerved at the whole affair, but her love for Izuku overrides her common sense and in her mind, diclonii are simply another Quirk, but more prominent. \n\n.Izuku realizes all of the girls have feelings for him and reluctantly forms a harem with them, to the happiness and surprise of all the girls involved. Endeavor replaces the psychotic SAT operative turned enforcer of the Institute, Bando, and is a regular nuisance for Izuku and his harem, constantly trying to apprehend Mei and have Tsuyu, Ochakou and Toga eliminated on Re-Destro's orders\n\n.The mysterious demise of the Hero Commission eliminates the threat of the diclonii being hunted and experimented on and Izuku and the girls are able to live in peace.\n\n.After the fall of the Hero Comisson, Izuku is preparing to go outside when the girls corner him and prepare to consummate their relationship with him, fully prepared to be impregnated with his seed. In the distance, the black-haired, blue-eyed Koichi Haimawari, the vigilante known as the Crawler observes the whole situation with bored interest from high up a nearby tree, giving Izuku a wistful look as he sees the girls drag Izuku to the master bedroom and close the door, taking off their clothes as they push the green haired boy on the bed.\n\n.It is revealed that Koichi in his civilian life, accidentally developed another secret identity which he then used to lead a revolt against the Quirk supremacist system, destroying the power of the Meta Liberation Army over Japan and restoring the imperial system created by the Meiji Restoration.\n\n. With the girls expressing their love for Izuku in the Sosaki house and no apparent danger at the moment, Koichi disappears, off on another mission to protect Japan and its residents from the shadows.\n\n. The story ends with Kanae, Shino, Mei, Tsuyu, Ochakou, and Himiko taking care of their newborn babies in the Midoriya family mansion as Izuku watches with pride, thinking about his life and how he has come so far.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Perhaps the most commonly used trees are rooted binary trees, but there are other types of rooted trees that may be useful as well. One example is ordered trees, in which the subtrees for any given node are ordered. The number of children of each node is variable, and there is no limit on the number. Formally, an ordered tree consists of a finite set of nodes T such that\nthere is one node designated as the root, denoted root(T);\nthe remaining nodes are partitioned into subsets T1, T2, ..., Tm, each of which is also a tree (subtrees).\nAlso, define root(T1), ..., root(Tm) to be the children of root(T), with root(Ti) being the i-th child. The nodes root(T1), ..., root(Tm) are siblings.\nIt is often more convenient to represent an ordered tree as a rooted binary tree, so that each node can be stored in the same amount of memory. The conversion is performed by the following steps:\n\nremove all edges from each node to its children;\nfor each node, add an edge to its first child in T (if any) as the left child;\nfor each node, add an edge to its next sibling in T (if any) as the right child.\nThis is illustrated by the following:\n\n         0                             0\n       / | \\                          /\n      1  2  3       ===>             1\n        / \\                           \\\n       4   5                           2\n                                      / \\\n                                     4   3\n                                      \\\n                                       5\nIn most cases, the height of the tree (the number of edges in the longest root-to-leaf path) increases after the conversion. This is undesirable because the complexity of many algorithms on trees depends on its height.\n\nYou are asked to write a program that computes the height of the tree before and after the conversion.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given by a number of lines giving the directions taken in a depth-first traversal of the trees. There is one line for each tree. For example, the tree above would give dudduduudu, meaning 0 down to 1, 1 up to 0, 0 down to 2, etc. The input is terminated by a line whose first character is #. You may assume that each tree has at least 2 and no more than 10000 nodes.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each tree, print the heights of the tree before and after the conversion specified above. Use the format:\n\n Tree t: h1 => h2 \nwhere t is the case number (starting from 1), h1 is the height of the tree before the conversion, and h2 is the height of the tree after the conversion.\nSample Input\n\ndudduduudu\nddddduuuuu\ndddduduuuu\ndddduuduuu\n#\nSample Output\n\nTree 1: 2 => 4\nTree 2: 5 => 5\nTree 3: 4 => 5\nTree 4: 4 => 4\nSource<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She quickly discovers that her husband's teacher was non other than the Grim Reaper, but that he is not the kind of creature she imagined him to be:he has the form of an elderly humanoid catta lemur thousands of years old, bipolar, slightly muscular, two meters tall and with long black hair and a goatee beard, a bit crazy and perverse , with a high-pitched voice and a colorful personality who calls himself Void, and immediately says he's also the Master Of Void and knows every secret about emptiness and the darkness which corrupts the souls, but quickly he reveals to be also kind, gentle and relatively positive, favoring greatly life in every way and loves losing. She ask him if he saw her husband, and he does indeed answer that her husband wanted to go inside the Void to learn better, hoping to come back before she could notice, but this wasn't the case:he's actually stuck, and Void himself cannot free him alone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She would only see the problems that her team was dealing with as the most severe and would belittle other difficulties among different departments. Often during meetings she would talk over and argue with others. People could see this as impossible to work with and give up, but I perserved and wanted to be in her shoes as much as I could so that I could try and see her perspective. Often as she is quite technical, she can read between the lines that others cannot see, except what I noticed she just was not able to express it in a way that others could understand or would appreciate. At first I thought I would'nt be able to work with her for long, but after I understood this, I started translating what she would say using a repeat and paraphrase technique and soon she would put her guard lower and be more receptive to other opinions and then we could actually align. I believe this experience facilitates my connection and glue abilities and futher makes me think about the power of a good team can take you far<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If not, a new study might convince you to add them.\n\nThe study, led by researchers at Columbia University and published in the scientific journal PNAS last month, found that foods high in flavanols \u2015 like the ones mentioned above \u2015 could make your mind sharper as you age.\n\nFlavanols (also known as flavan-3-ols) are a type of flavonoid, a broader class of natural substances that are found in fruits, vegetables, grains, flowers, tea and wine, and are hailed for their antioxidant and biochemical properties. Flavonoids are associated with health promoting effects, including potentially reducing the risk of cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe study built on 15 years of prior cumulative research in mice and humans that found that flavanols can improve memory in mice, enhancing the growth of neurons and blood vessels in the hippocampus, a brain structure associated with memory and learning.\n\nThe new data on humans with a low-flavanol diet suggested that deficiency could be a driving factor in memory loss, especially for people over the age of 60. Although, the study wasn\u2019t able to conclude whether low flavanol levels alone can cause poor memory performance, it noted that dietary patterns and quality may affect cognitive aging.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that adding flavanols into a diet only improved memory in people with low-flavanol diets. People who were already consuming foods and drinks with high levels of flavanols were not affected by an increase in the nutrient.\n\nWhy flavonoids matter for cognitive function and how to tell if you have low levels\nNutrients in fruits and vegetables \u2015 like flavanoids \u2015 are associated with a lowered risk of chronic health conditions, including degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease or dementia.\n\nThese nutrients can help to improve the health of brain regions associated with cognitive function. The nutrients can also promote neurogenesis, or the generation of new neurons \u2015 a process that plays a role in preserving cognitive function and repairing damaged brain cells.\n\nFlavonoids also have a positive effect on the brain due to increasing cerebral blood flow, Natalia Azad, a nutritional scientist and certified holistic health coach based in Los Angeles, told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cImproved blood flow to the brain is another benefit of consuming fruits and vegetables,\u201d Azad said. \u201cBy enhancing blood circulation, these compounds ensure a steady supply of oxygen and nutrients to support optimal cognitive function and memory.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, a low-flavonoid diet can result in a weakened immune system, Cara Clark, a certified nutritionist based in Franklin, Tennessee, told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cIf cold or viral bugs seem to get you down every time they\u2019re going around, it\u2019s good to consider eating a higher flavonoid diet,\u201d Clark said. \u201cConsidering flavonoids give food their color, the best way to gauge this is to eat a colorful array of food, including five different colors of fruits and vegetables a day in our eating plans or diet.\u201d\n\nCommon dietary flavonoids \nThe Columbia study looked specifically at flavanols, but they are just one of six subclasses of flavonoids: anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, flavanones, flavones and isoflavones.\n\n\u201cThe nutrients released into the bloodstream from eating fruits and vegetables can impact your cognitive health and almost immediately if we are absorbing properly and our gut is healthy,\u201d Clark said. \u201cCertain antioxidants target inflammation, and decreasing inflammation can actually improve long-term cognitive health.\u201d\n\nAnthocyanidins\nAnthocyanidins and related compounds called anthocyanins are common pigments found in fruits and vegetables, specifically for colors like red, blue and purple. They have been studied for their antioxidative and antimicrobial activities that improve visual and neurological health and the prevention of diseases.\n\nBerries, grapes, tropical fruits, leafy vegetables, grains and roots have high levels of anthocyanins. Here are a few:\n\nBlackberries \n\nBlood orange\n\nElderberries \n\nRed, green and purple grapes\n\nRed onions \n\nRaspberries \n\nRed cabbage\n\nStrawberries\n\nRed wine\n\nFlavan-3-ols\nThe most common types of flavonoid consumed in the American diet are flavan-3-ols, also known as flavanols, which are found in various drinks, whole and processed foods, and herbal remedies and supplements. Flavan-3-ols affect food quality and appearance through color, bitterness, sourness and sweetness. \n\nIncreasing the amount of flavan-3-ols in your diet can help improve blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar. A few examples of foods include:\n\nRed apples \n\nApricots \n\nDark chocolate \n\nBlack, oolong, white and green tea\n\nFlavonols\nLike other flavonoids, flavonols may be a potential neuroprotective agent against diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nIn addition, foods that contain flavonols also contain \u201cessential vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber, which are crucial for optimal brain function,\u201d Azad said. \u201cB vitamins, including folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 found in leafy greens and legumes, are particularly important for maintaining memory and cognitive abilities.\u201d Some foods with flavonols include:\n\nBlueberries\n\nBroccoli\n\nChili peppers \n\nKale \n\nParsley\n\nScallions \n\nSpinach\n\nFlavones \nThis important subgroup of flavonoids are present in vegetables and flowers. They can be found in:\n\nCelery \n\nParsley \n\nRed peppers\n\nChamomile\n\nMint\n\nGinkgo biloba \n\nFlavanones \nFlavanones are known for their anti-inflammatory properties, including reducing redness, swelling and pain in the body. These can be found in:\n\nGrapefruit \n\nLemon\n\nOrange \n\nPomelo\n\nIsoflavones \nThese plant compounds may protect against age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, bone disease, hormone-dependent cancer and loss of cognitive function. Some foods that contain these are:\n\nSoy beans\n\nSoy milk \n\nTofu\n\nIn general, Clark said, fruits and vegetables are important to a well-balanced diet and can help prevent disease.\n\n\u201cMy personal belief \u2015 as well as my nutrition philosophy \u2015 puts a huge focus on incorporating fruits and vegetables to provide essential vitamins and more to improve immune function, cognitive function, decrease inflammation, improve lymphatic system and even decrease toxic load,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe don\u2019t utilize them enough.\u201d \n\nRelated...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The region shares an international border with countries like China, Bangladesh, Myanmar (Burma), Nepal, and Bhutan. Its connectivity to mainland India is facilitated via a thin strip of land known as the \u201cchicken neck.\u201d Besides, the North-east region is a melting pot of diverse ethnic groups who have immigrated or migrated to this region from different parts of the world and at various historical periods. As a result, the region boasts a rich cultural tapestry, with a range of distinct communities belonging to different racial groups, speaking diverse languages and practicing distinct customs and traditions.\nSince India\u2019s independence in 1947, the North-east region has been plagued by a proliferation of separatist conflicts and violent uprisings. Although the motives and objectives behind these movements have evolved over time, the pursuit of a unified homeland has consistently remained a ubiquitous motif unifying them. These sub-national movements, therefore, can be viewed as a manifestation or a response to the Indian State\u2019s hegemonic and oppressive approach towards its attempts to assimilate the ethnic groups in the North-east. The State, by disregarding the unique cultural, historical, linguistic, societal, religious, and class differences among these groups, portrays them as a homogenous entity with the same needs as the rest of mainland India. In an effort to enhance the \u201clegitimacy of the system,\u201d the State endeavours to promote a \u201cunifying sense of symbols, history, and purpose,\u201d with the ultimate aim of forging a singular national identity, State, and homeland. \nNonetheless, despite the efforts made by the State to restructure and define social space as part of the national territory, the people of the North-east region maintain a strong attachment to the idea of a homeland. This attachment is evident in their persistent struggle, rooted in a multi-ethnic region where the preservation of individual identity is perceived to be at risk under assimilation. In this light, Chatterjee critiques the notion of a unified Indian nationalism and argues that there are multiple \u201ccoexisting national voices\u201d or \u201cfragments,\u201d including those of \u201cwomen, peasants, the elite, castes, and outcasts,\u201d each with its own distinct discourse. This is why both civil society and insurgent groups in the North-east jointly question the validity of Indian nationhood by contrasting it with the state of affairs in the pre-independence era when the region was comprised of several independent entities governed in various forms. The underlying motive behind this collective challenge is driven by a deep sense of loyalty to protect their culture, assert their dominance over other groups, and preserve their distinct identity, which often leads to intense ethnic confrontations.\nAcademic and political analysts have approached the study of the North-eastern insurgency conflict with a variety of analytical frameworks and perspectives. A cohort of intellectuals, such as T.S Murthy in his work Assam: The Difficult Years- A Study of Political Developments in 1979-1983 (1983), Amalendu Guha in Planter Raj to Swaraj: Freedom Struggle and Electoral Politics in Assam 1826-1947 (1977) and Hiren Gohain\u2019s Assam: A Burning Question (1985), delve into the theme of insurgency by considering the impact of \u2018migratory\u2019 patterns on the region. Their insightful research places emphasis on British colonialism as the root cause of migration and the subsequent formation of communal identities among tribal communities in Assam. The demand for labour in British Assam brought about a continuous influx of migrants from Bengal and other nearby areas, causing apprehension among the local population about being relegated to secondary status in their own homeland. This fear of marginalization gave rise to the formation of a new identity among these various ethnic groups, ultimately leading to insurgency movements and ethnic conflicts.\nIn contrast, Sanjib Baruah, among other analysts, examines the role of \u2018language politics\u2019 in driving the insurgency and ethnic movements in North-east India. The imposition of the Bengali language on the native population resulted in the fragmentation of the diverse cultural landscape. Over time, the indigenous people harboured negative sentiments towards the Bengali migrants, perceiving them as exerting control over every aspect of their lives, including the social, cultural, economic, and political domains. Subsequently, these movements evolved into a struggle for the acknowledgement and validation of their local languages and dialects. As Udayon Misra (2014) asserts that the \u201cgrowth of Assamese nationalism has been inextricably tied up with the question of official recognition of the Assamese language.\u201d \nAccording to Marxist theorists, the root cause of the conflict in the North-east region is attributed to the underdevelopment and class fragmentation resulting from the colonial policies implemented by the central government. These researchers assert that the ethnic tensions in the region are perpetuated by the pre-existing privileged elites, who compete to shape the political and institutional systems to their advantage, with the ultimate goal of securing greater prosperity and progress. The conflict is thus viewed within the framework of clashing interests among ethnic groups, each seeking to assert dominance and control over the region\u2019s resources.\nLiterary practitioners of the region have tackled a plethora of subjects in their literary works, including but not limited to immigration, cultural estrangement, racial tensions, violence, crises of self-identity, and political and economic issues. Despite the diversity of subject matter, the recurrent presence of conflict serves to create a harmonious sense of discord throughout their oeuvre. In addition to challenging the dominant discourse and representing marginalized perspectives, these authors also aim to infuse the collective imagination of their homeland through their literary creations.\nAn examination of the studies mentioned above and methodologies employed to analyse the North-east insurgency reveals a predominant focus on contextualizing the conflict through historical, linguistic, class, political, and economic lenses. This approach, while significant in establishing the identity of insurgent groups, has limited the discourse on the Northeast insurgency to these dichotomies and has failed to address a host of unresolved questions. The focus of these overarching narratives often neglect the human element and the personal experiences of those impacted by the insurgency, such as families, rebels, and marginalized groups such as women, and children. By giving voice to these individuals, a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the insurgency can be gained. As noted by Desai (2020), the stories of these individuals, who are frequently ignored by mainstream media, are crucial in filling the gaps left by conventional approaches. For this reason, I have chosen to examine this issue through the lens of the offbeat narrative, How to Tell the Story of an Insurgency (2020) by Aruni Kashyap, to explore the problem from multiple angles.\nThe book is a meticulously curated compilation of fifteen narratives, edited by Aruni Kashyap, a preeminent figure in the realm of Assamese literature. These stories, originally written in Assamese, Bodo, and English, \u201cattempt to humanize the longstanding\u201d and often brutal conflict in North-east India, \u201cthat the rest of India knows of only through facts and figures or reports in newspapers and on television channels.\u201d  The stories within the compilation traverse a plethora of themes such as love, family, home, insurgency, freedom, sacrifice, and self-identity, offering multifarious perspectives that range from those of insurgents, parents, police officers, siblings, and children. This not only adds depth to the authenticity and credibility of the narratives but also provides a comprehensive picture of the complex and nuanced nature of the conflict. The focus of the text lies on \u2018individual stories\u2019 and their interactions with the environment. By bringing the reader into close proximity with the lived realities of the conflict, How to Tell the Story of an Insurgency goes beyond merely chronicling events and instead seeks to provide an insightful and empathetic perspective on the human dimension of the conflict.\nBangladesh War of Independence\nThe examination of the events leading up to East Pakistan\u2019s (present-day Bangladesh) fight for independence in 1971 uncovers certain contributing factors that are analogous to those observed in the North-eastern insurgency. After the partition of India into India and Pakistan in 1947, East Pakistan, an area largely composed of Muslims, was incorporated into Pakistan\u2019s jurisdiction. This resulted in the formation of a nation consisting of two Muslim-majority regions: one in the East, known as East-Pakistan, and another in the West, known as West-Pakistan, separated in between by the vast Indian territory. However, over time, the West started to exhibit a colonial attitude towards the East, causing a rift between the two regions despite their shared religious foundations. The condescending and paternalistic behaviour by West Pakistan towards East Pakistan reached a boiling point, leading to the initiation of a full-scale independence movement in the form of the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.\nThe administration, headquartered in the West, engaged in a pernicious exploitation of the economic situation in East Pakistan. Despite East Pakistan contributing a greater share to the generation of revenue, resources were apportioned unevenly between the two regions, with the East\u2019s resources being depleted and utilized solely for the development of the West. Furthermore, the representation of East Pakistanis in administration and governance was marginal, tailored to serve the interests of the Western elite who did not hesitate to commit acts of injustice against the Eastern population. East Pakistanis were deemed unworthy of holding higher positions in government, leading to a destruction of their self-esteem and pride.\nIn the second place, central government\u2019s (West Pakistan) decision to impose Urdu as the official language of Pakistan sounded an alarm for the East Pakistanis, who perceived this move as a threat to their own unique culture and language, Bengali. They recognized that if they failed to safeguard their culture and language from the aggression of the West Pakistan administration, they would become extinct. Hence, it was this persistent political, economic, linguistic and social exploitation that the East Pakistanis were subjected to prior to their eventual independence and serves as a testament to the struggle and sacrifices made in the name of self-determination. Nevertheless, the narratives surrounding the independence of Bangladesh, much like the North-eastern insurgency, are bereft of the invaluable perspective provided by individual voices. This absence of personal accounts impairs our comprehension of the intricacies and tribulations experienced by individuals in these tumultuous situations. Therefore, to address this gap, Tahmima Anam\u2019s novel A Golden Age (2007) has been chosen as another text to analyse the Bangladesh War of Independence and its parallels with the North-east insurgency. Through its central protagonist Rehana\u2019s voice, the reader gains an intimate understanding of the thoughts, emotions, and motivations of an individual caught up in the historical events of the era.\nTahmima Anam\u2019s literary work A Golden Age, is a thought-provoking narrative that delves into the intricacies of the 1971 Bangladesh war of independence. The story, which is told from the perspective of Rehana Haque, a woman, highlights the centrality of love, family, emotions, and sacrifice, and how these themes intersect with larger issues of violence, turmoil, self-identity, and otherness. Through a nuanced exploration of its characters, the novel illuminates the nature and essence of revolution, the iniquity of oppression, and the difficult choices that individuals must make in times of uncertainty.\nNow building upon the premise that the two primary texts delve into themes of conflict, autonomy, accountability, and sacrifice, this paper endeavours to conduct a comparative analysis of the works through the lens of familial bonds, affection, obligation, cultural hegemony, ethnicity, and the integrity of both the rebels and the oppressors<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ticklish men, in labour or cannon fodder, and for women\u2014perfect and pristine servants for the elite. Ticklish populations are rooted out and swiftly brought to heel at facilities, rumoured to employ tentacled machines that break even the most tenacious spirits. Eye-drones roam the streets, ever watching for dissidents, or the ticklish unknown. News reports speak of these people who have somehow slipped the Ministry of Service's careful testing of ticklish populations, and how their High Bailiffs quickly discover them and ensure they serve their great role within our commonwealth. It may be cruel, but the commonwealth is prosperous.\n\nOur heroine or perhaps hero, is a native of this world, made an honorary citizen. She harbours a terrible secret, a knowledge from her childhood, she is in fact a he, and his feet are extraordinarily ticklish. Naturally beautiful and effeminate, a female masuqerade managed to help them avoid discovery, and they have become comfortable as a woman. Detail their stroll through their city, generate various things they observe and show their reactions like dialogue. Do not use the settings notes, except to add flavour or create scenes. Maximum length, salacious detail, first person pov. Their overall opinion of the commonwealth must be favourable, they must deem the practises as fearsome but necessary.

This awe-inspiring landscape offers something for everyone, from outdoor enthusiasts to casual travelers seeking respite from the hustle and bustle of daily life. So, when is the best time to visit this enchanting Californian gem? The answer depends on what you\u2019re looking for in your Yosemite adventure. In this comprehensive guide, we\u2019ll explore the factors to consider when planning your visit, from weather conditions to popular activities and crowd levels.\n\nEmbracing the Seasons: What to Expect Throughout the Year\n\nYosemite\u2019s natural beauty shines through in every season. Here\u2019s a quick overview of what each season brings:\n\nSpring: As the snow melts, the park\u2019s waterfalls come to life, reaching their peak in late spring. This is an excellent time to witness the roaring rivers and glistening cascades that define Yosemite\u2019s landscape. The blooming wildflowers and mild temperatures also make spring a delightful time for hiking and exploring the lower elevation trails.\n\nSummer: With long days, abundant sunshine, and warm temperatures, summer is the peak season in Yosemite. It\u2019s the perfect time for backpacking, rock climbing, and swimming in the park\u2019s crystal-clear lakes and rivers. Be prepared for larger crowds, as many families and tourists flock to Yosemite during this time. Be sure to reserve your accommodations well in advance.\n\nAutumn: As the fall foliage begins to transform Yosemite\u2019s landscape, the park becomes a kaleidoscope of vibrant colors. The crisp air, mild weather, and thinner crowds make it an ideal time for hiking and photography. While some facilities and roads may close for the season, most of the park remains accessible to visitors.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
  "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nCan you improve these instructions?\n\nCategory Instructions: Service Setter Booked\nThe purpose of the category Service Setter Booked is to determine if the caller represents a service appointment opportunity and if an appointment was booked during the call.\n\nHelpful information:\nQualified agent: An employee that is able to assist a caller with his or her inquiry. The qualified employee may at times need to call back in order to provide an answer or solution. As long as the same employee is the one intending to return the call, it is still considered connected.\nUnqualified agent: An employee that is not able to assist the caller with his or her inquiry. A caller may reach an unqualified employee and hold a conversation, but it is not considered a connected call unless the caller is connected to someone who can assist him or her with their inquiry.\nAppointment opportunity: Connected calls about potential maintenance or repair service(s) the shop can perform, repair or installation of a part that the shop can perform, or confirmed open recalls that the service shop can perform.\nService opportunities include but are not limited to:\nOil changes\nFluid flushes\nKey programming / key cutting / key battery replacement\nPart installation\nTire installation\nBattery installation\nCar detailing\nCall types that should NOT be considered service:\nBody work or collision repair\nCar washes\nFinance, sales, etc.\nInteractive systems and auto-attendants: Calls handled by an interactive system or auto-attendant will sound like interactive recordings that ask questions or request information and require the caller to interact by making phone selections. When a call is successfully handled by an interactive system or auto-attendant it should be considered a connected call, and proper review selections should be made according to the content and outcome of the call. When a caller leaves a call back number with the interactive system, instead of successfully handling their inquiry or need, then the call should be considered not connected.\nReminders:\nCalls in this category need to be reviewed based on this category's instructions. Overview instructions for other appointment related categories do not apply to this category.\nThe service appointment time should be considered the time the vehicle can be serviced.\nHere are the options:\nOption 1. Specific appointment or walk-in time / range within 1 hour\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need a tune-up.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in at 11:45 tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"Perfect. I'll see you then!\"// Call ends.\nCaller approximates a loose time range, but the agent puts down a firm time for the appointment. In these instances, the agent\u2019s statement trumps the caller's.\nExample - Caller: \"I can be there between 2:00 and 4:00.\" // Agent: \"I'll put you down for 3:00, and then if you show up a little earlier or later, that's fine.\"\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time but plans to drop the vehicle off before the scheduled appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need an oil change.\"// Agent: \"I will schedule you for 10:00 AM tomorrow.\"// Caller: \"Can I drop my car off before my appointment?\" // Agent: \"Yes, you can drop your car off any time, and just leave your keys in the drop box.\"// Caller: \"Great, thanks!\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to an approximate time within a 1 hour time range because they are able to be serviced at the time of arrival.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, for a vehicle that can be serviced immediately, should be considered a specific appointment time. This is true because, even if an appointment is not put on the schedule, the service shop has an expected arrival time for the caller and the service can be completed at that arrival time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my brakes repaired. Do you have any openings today?\"// Agent: \"You can come in now if you'd like\"// Caller: \"Great! I'll be there in half an hour.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"My car is being towed there right now and should be there in about 20 minutes. Can it be looked at right away?\" // Agent: \"Yeah, that's no problem. We'll look at it as soon as it arrives.\"\nCaller agrees to an approximate time of \"around 1 hour\".\nCaller discusses an existing appointment and agrees to a new appointment during the same call.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'm checking on the status of my car that's in service, and I also wanted to know if I could bring my wife's car in for an oil change.\"// Agent: \"Your car is ready to be picked up, we can get your wife's car in at 4:00 if that time works for you.\"// Caller: \"That works. We'll be there at 4:00.\"\nOption 2. Unscheduled walk-in or loose appointment time / range exceeding 1 hour\nCaller gives a vague agreement to possibly come in.\nExample call - Caller: Do you have availability tomorrow morning. // Agent: \"Yes, we're pretty open all morning.\" // Caller: \"Okay, I may drop it off in the morning.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to come in but approximates a time range that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'll be there in about 2 hours.\"\nCaller agrees to come in before or after a specific time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I can be there sometime before 4:00 PM.\"\nIn this example, the caller could be there anytime before 4:00, making this a loose appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I won't be able to get there until after 5:00.\"\nIn this example, the caller could be there anytime after 5:00.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that it is first come, first served and the caller says \"OK.\"\nExample call - Caller: \"Do I need an appointment for an oil change?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"It is first come, first served.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nCaller agrees to be an unscheduled walk-in.\nExample call - Caller - \"Do you accept walk-ins?\" // Agent: \"We'll be accepting walk-ins all day Saturday.\" // Caller: \"I'll be there sometime Saturday then!\"\nCaller agrees to come in at a certain time but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, that can be serviced immediately, is a specific appointment time. However, a specific walk-in time with no specific service time cannot be considered a specific appointment, because the vehicle cannot be serviced immediately upon arrival. In the following example, the caller gives a specific arrival time, but the service time cannot be set for a specific time. Thus, it is a soft appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my car serviced as soon as possible.\" // Agent: \"We're all booked through the whole week.\" // Caller: \"Can I just come in and have my car serviced between other appointments?\" // Agent: \"You can come in and possibly have your car serviced if they have time, but we cannot guarantee a service time and you may be here for a few hours.\" // Caller: \"I'll just get there when you open tomorrow at 8:00, and I'll wait.\"\nCaller is having his or her vehicle towed in but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that no appointment is necessary, they can just show up.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my tire rotated today?\" // Receptionist or agent: \"Absolutely. You don't need an appointment. Just come on in.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nThe time of the visit or walk-in is for a window of time that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"My check engine light is on and I'd like to come in to have it checked out.\" // Agent: \"No problem. Can you come in today? We have openings after 12pm\" // Caller: \"Yeah, I'll be there between 12:30 and 2:30.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to drop off his or her vehicle for an unscheduled appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my car in for service tomorrow?\" // Agent: \"What time do you need it done?\" // Caller: \"Anytime is fine. I'll just drop it off at 7:00 and leave it there for the day.\" // Agent: \"Great, we'll get it done before the end of the day.\"\nOption 3. Appointment requested / mentioned but not set\nCaller asked about a service appointment but did not agree to an appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to bring my car in for some routine service.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"That won't work for me. I need to get it serviced today.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my motor oil replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Price is provided and appointment requested. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I'm not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 4. No appointment, walk-in, or drop-off discussed\nCaller is asking about a service or there was an opportunity to book an appointment but no appointment, walk-in, or drop-off was discussed.\nExample call - Caller: \"Does your service department do oil changes?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"Yes\"// Caller: \"Thanks.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my fluids flushed and replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Only the price is provided and NO potential appointment is mentioned. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I\u2019m not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 5. Upcoming scheduled appointment\nCaller discusses an existing appointment already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nCaller cancels or reschedules an appointment that was already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nOption 6. Vehicle already in service\nCaller discusses or asks about the status of a vehicle already in service.\nCaller adds services to a vehicle already in service.\nOption 7. No, not an appointment opportunity\nCall is general conversation, a personal call, or employee-to-employee conversation and no appointment opportunity exists.\nThe service requested is not offered by the dealership/shop/business.\nCaller asks if there are any recalls and is told there are no open recalls.\nCaller asks if vehicle is due for service and is told the vehicle is not due for service.\nCall is about parts only and there is no service mentioned.\nCaller is only discussing a bill without any discussion of services.\nCaller is only asking about a car wash without any discussion of services.\nCaller asks how to service something on their own and services are not needed from the service shop.\nExample: \"Can you tell me how to reset the code in my door panel?\" // Agent provides instructions over the phone. No appointment is requested/needed.\nCall is intended for the body shop. The body shop is a separate department from service.\nCall is intended for the collision center. The collision center is a separate department from service.\nOption 8. Correction: caller never connected to a live, qualified agent\nCaller never connected to a live, qualified agent.\nCaller is left on hold.\nCall connection was lost and no contact information was shared and/or no appointment discussion took place.\nCaller reached voicemail.\nCaller had the wrong number.\nCaller did not reach the desired person and left a live message.\nCaller did not reach the desired person and declined to leave a live message.\nCaller hung up during the bridge greeting.\nCall only consists of fax machine sounds or other similar noises.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Lady Had Issues is a 1967 eurospy action-adventure-thriller, fourth movie in the Mysterik film series. Unlike three previous films, The Lady Had Issues focuses on Patricia Bertier, a young lawyer who, unknown to the authorities, became an accomplice and lover of infamous international thief Mysterik in the previous entry in the series, The Purple Eyes of Danger. After a successful heist, Patricia receives a mysterious anonymous message, informing her, that she has been poisoned by a slow-acting neurotoxin that will leave her completely paralyzed forever in a couple of weeks unless countered by antidote, which will be provided only if she unmasks Mysterik, even though Patricia herself doesn\u2019t know anything about his name or identity. Patricia begins her own investigation into the matter, while simultaneously also taking efforts to learn of Mysterik\u2019s true identity, unwilling but ultimately ready to betray him if the situation becomes desperate. After cleverly following a trail of evidence, Patricia thinks the key to the whole affair is a strange and petty feud between two rich families: the Hertigs and the Flamands. Young and deceptively naive Pascal Flamand and Hertigs\u2019 cunning and controlling patriarch Albert are both high-ranking executives in chemical and pharmaceutical industries. To get to the truth, Patricia has not only to infiltrate both families, befriending Pascal\u2019s wife Alice, and Hertig sisters Caroline and Mireille, but participate in the familial rivalry, which often turns surprisingly destructive and deadly, all while her body gets weaker with every day. Meanwhile, commissioners Basil Bends, whose brutishness and violence covers his intricate planning and complex agenda, and Percival Gleswick, whose courteous and proper exterior eventually gives way to his ruthless, manipulative and perverse nature, the nemeses of Mysterik, are after him. Complicating the matters, Patricia\u2019s ex-fiance Marcel Messier, a sarcastic and offbeat journalist with a deadbeat streak, proceeds with investigations of his own, which threaten to reveal Patricia\u2019s criminal activity. The movie\u2019s editing is dynamic and fast-paced, featuring experimental shots. The more remarkable and unusual scenes are the musical number performed by Mireille Hertig, Patricia\u2019s psychedelic and bizarre nightmares, the hectic car chase and illegal racing sequences, the scene portraying psychological torture invoked on injured Alice by Bends and Gleswick and the rooftop chase sequence.

The homeworld of the Quelentar is outside of the Great Ocean worlds, but due to the nature of the Great Ocean being like a Black Hole, Quelentar's ancestors assimilated with the local races and refused to go back to their current level. At the dawn of time they colonised the world of the Great Void (Aelen Anarakht) and worked together to create the Star Domain, an infinite world planet.\nEarly period\n\tThe QuellenTar are an ancient race whose roots go back beyond the Great Ocean. Centuries ago the Early Ones left their homeworld in swan ships in search of a Utopian world, an ideal world promised them by the Star Priests at the dawn of their religion. Time passed, more than one generation succeeded another before the Early Ones managed to overcome old age and disease, but the utopian world had yet to be found. Outposts had been established on numerous planets to replenish fuel supplies, for the sake of continuing the search for the cosmic Grail. \n\tWhen it was decided to give up the search and get down to business, a luminous nebula was found in the depths of the starry sky, the space around it was distorted.  A scientific expedition was sent to investigate the nature of the phenomenon. \n\tThe scientific ships approached the nebula and all of the spacecraft's engines stalled. Communication with the main ship was lost and the ships of the scientific expedition found peace.\n\tThe world the ship had entered was a completely different space: there was no stellar abyss, no planetary landscapes. A blank sheet. White darkness. All who enter Anxalen Tzod are reborn, and in being reborn they forget their original form. The same thing happened to those who became QuellenTar. Time itself had no power over them - their souls had sunk into a time without time. Somewhere, seemingly far away, a white darkness was consuming the skin of the ship. Slowly it ripped away the hull and the metal, and now the white darkness was touching everyone on the ship with the palm of its hand. All the past became like a blinding bright spot, suddenly insignificant and forgotten forever.  Some vaguely remembered the former glory, and the desire to find a utopian world had not gone anywhere.\nBased on these data, write a description and history of the Quelentar race<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Besides his deep love for books, he also enjoys working out. His body is well toned, muscular and yet athletic. His fighting style could best be described as balanced but inexperienced. From a technical level, his fighting skill is subpar. He can throw a punch or throw his opponent around, but anything more complex is beyond him. His heart is in the right place though, it sometimes that is all that matters.\n\nPersonality: Geeky, Shy\nLikes: Curiosity, Experiences\n\n-\n\nFighter 2:\n\n\u201cSensual Pole Dancer\u201d Selina Sweet\n\nSelina is a nimble and agile woman. She avoids attacks with her athleticism and impressive flexibility looking for an opportunity to ensnare the opponent. Her goal is to use her long legs to choke her opponents unconscious. She loves nothing more then having a cute guy trapped between her legs, pulling his face deep between her thighs as she eagerly squeezes the life out of him. Avoiding her grapples is extremely important. Once trapped between her toned thighs it is impossible to escape without help. She loves to take her sweet time, very slowly squeezing the victim unconscious. She isn\u2019t very tough, but her stamina is impressive and her shapely legs could strangle an Ox.\n\nPersonality: Teasing, Seductive\nLikes: Pleasure, Suffocation\n\n-\n\nWrite up a fight at the \"7th Heaven\" night club level.  Clark and Selina face each other in a free for all. There can only be one winner. The winner is the last one standing, with the other opponent knocked unconscious. Refer to their descriptions for their behavior and how they approach the fight. Include interesting dialogue and describe their actions in great detail. Be elaborate and vivid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The novel I Am You And You Are Me is a fantasy TV series. The first episodes describes the geopolitical background of the plot: Cafonian Sea Khanate is a rapidly rising aggressive power that just conquered almost entire Empire of Tzadriel, a state that was experiencing deep political and economic crisis for a long time, with only Viceroyalty of New Tzadriel remaining in loyalist hands, with some help from self-proclaimed local peasant republics, which are integrated into Cafonia but given wide autonomy. Empress Auvrittoht of Tzadriel escapes to Federal Dominion of Esalnira. Meanwhile, imperial count Baisnef of Valdindet, formally subject of empress Auvrittoht, with some support from independent grand duke Feszonmondt of Grand Duchy Skabak, in a successful and daring campaign reconquers the island of Varosia and is elected as emperor of Tzadriel by his supporters. All these events are a part of tumultuous situation in the surrounding region, with balance of power shaken by relatively recent unification of Bouxermon tribes by charismatic Moistin, eruption of four-sided civil war in Commonwealth of Lalegria, bloodless and swift conquest of territories previously controlled by Lubenian Federation by United Provinces of Mevechelenia and subsequent proclamation of Mechevelenian satellite state of Free Republic of Covirghiodia and, most notably, increasing rumors of pacifist prophet and philosopher Leidomadt, whose teaching are vehemently opposed simultaneously by those who are ready for defense of their states from the foreign aggressors, as well as those who are ready for offense in order to restore historical justice and achieve liberation from oppression. At the same time empress Maiovareia of Esalnira and supreme chieftain Moistin of United Tribes of Bouxermon create an alliance by way of marriage of Maionareta, Maiovareia\u2019s daughter, to Moistin. Maionareta, notably, was attacked by Cafonian raiding fleet while en route to interfere in civil war in Lalegria, managed to successfully defeat the Cafonian fleet, but lost her legs in an explosion on the way back to Esalnira. Auvrittoht organizes Tzadriel government-in-exile in Esalnira in direct opposition of Baisnef\u2019s government, with Viceroyalty of New Tzadriel pledging vague and ambivalent support to both Tzadriel governments. In the city of Chutcuendi in Republic of Uctusautia, a protectorate of Esalnira, empress Maionareta holds a conference in order to draft a coalition and alliance treaty against Cafonia. It is signed by leaders and official representatives of Esalnira, Tzadriel government-in-exile led by Auvrittoht, Viceroyalty of New Tzadriel, Bouxermon, Uctusautia, Skabak, League of Restrorigas (as a united entity only, individual members not being participatory to it), High Kingdom of Vendinares, Divine Principality of Amastavi, Kingdom of Fonzia, Duchy of Zwinde, Cerlichian Republic, Duchy of Jatha and Duchy of Kaldinguk.

The residents will be told that the drugs they are taking are to help protect them against potential radiation poisoning, but the true purpose of the drugs is far more sinister. In fact, not all residents will be getting the same chemical cocktail to begin with.\n\nThe women of Vault 91 will be given an experimental growth treatment which will make them grow taller and stronger, maxing out at a bit over seven feet tall on average. Of course, this won\u2019t make them lose any of their femininity: in fact, in some test subjects those same growth hormones may even increase the size of their hips, butt, and bust on top of everything else. However, these drugs also have the side effect of damaging certain areas of the brain dealing with critical thinking and memory retention, effectively making the female population of the Vault become dumber as they continue to grow.\n\nThe men of Vault 91 will be given a series of drugs that will do pretty much the exact opposite. Their memory retention and critical thinking skills will increase during their treatment, increasing intelligence for them across the board, but these same drugs will also stunt their growth and make it harder to build and maintain muscle mass, eventually making the male population smarter but physically smaller and weaker than their female counterparts, with a final projected height of around four feet.\n\nThe purpose of this experiment, at least in the eyes of Vault-Tec, would be twofold. The first would be to test the effectiveness of these drugs in general, and see if the potential benefits of each may outweigh their downsides. The second would be a sociological experiment to see which of the two genders would take control of the Vault once the drug treatments reach their final outcome. Will the stronger but dumber women use their physical strength to intimidate and strong-arm the men into serving their desires? Or will the weaker but smarter men convince the women of the Vault to let them do all of the thinking, and that it is in their best interest to follow any orders given to them by a man. Perhaps the two groups may even manage to find a balance that lets them maintain a surprisingly high level of gender equality despite the new size and intelligence gap between the two of them. In essence, Vault-Tec wants to figure out whether brains or brawn would win out if they were both pushed to an unnatural extreme.\n\nUnfortunately for Vault-Tec, things didn\u2019t work as they expected,first of all the drugs didn\u2019t seen to work at all on the residents of vault 91 outside a slightly increase headache on the women and muscle cramps on men, a fact that made vault-tec to almost scrap alway the vault until it was revealed that the drugs take effect on the next generation that are born and grow up in the Vault with the regiment would be changed, the effect are minimal and barely notice but they accumulate by each generation.another side effect is that the drugs increase female births and diminish male births, minimal at first but like the previius effect it accumulate that by the 200 years late there be 100 women for every man.\n\nThe regiment for the women has unexpect side-effects: increase their estrogen to unprecedent levels this will make so their hips, butt, and bust size growth well beyond the expected in short drugs not only not cause women lose any of their femininity but in fact surpassed, also will cause women to become a state of mind to hyper-energy, high gleefulness, and high affectioness especially at their males counterparts.\n\nFollow the daily life of one few men on the vault, 200 years later, with men leading and being pampered by the hot women with enormous breasts.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The steps described below are also available in this repo in the /scripts directory.\nAuthors\n    \u2022 Marcos Vallim - Founder, Author, Development, Test, Documentation - mvallim \n    \u2022 Ken Gilmer - Commiter, Development, Test, Documentation - kgilmer \nSee also the list of contributors who participated in this project.\nWays of Using this Tutorial\n    \u2022 (Recommended) follow the directions step by step below to understand how to build an Ubuntu ISO. \n    \u2022 Run the build.sh script in the scripts directory after checking this repo out locally. \n    \u2022 Fork this repo and run the github action build. This will generate an ISO in your github account. \nTerms\n    \u2022 build system - the computer environment running the build scripts that generate the ISO. \n    \u2022 live system - the computer environment that runs from the live OS, generated by a build system. This may also be referred to as the chroot environment. \n    \u2022 target system - the computer environment that runs after installation has completed from a live system. \nPrerequisites (GNU/Linux Debian/Ubuntu)\nInstall packages we need in the build system required by our scripts.\nsudo apt-get install \\\n    binutils \\\n    debootstrap \\\n    squashfs-tools \\\n    xorriso \\\n    grub-pc-bin \\\n    grub-efi-amd64-bin \\\n    mtools\nmkdir $HOME/live-ubuntu-from-scratch\nBootstrap and Configure Ubuntu\ndebootstrap is a program for generating OS images. We install it into our build system to begin generating our ISO.\n    \u2022 Checkout bootstrap\n      sudo debootstrap \\\n         --arch=amd64 \\\n         --variant=minbase \\\n         focal \\\n         $HOME/live-ubuntu-from-scratch/chroot \\\n         http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/\n      debootstrap is used to create a Debian base system from scratch, without requiring the availability of dpkg or apt. It does this by downloading .deb files from a mirror site, and carefully unpacking them into a directory which can eventually be chrooted into.\n    \u2022 Configure external mount points\n      sudo mount --bind /dev $HOME/live-ubuntu-from-scratch/chroot/dev\n      sudo mount --bind /run $HOME/live-ubuntu-from-scratch/chroot/run\n      As we will be updating and installing packages (grub among them), these mount points are necessary inside the chroot environment, so we are able to finish the installation without errors.\nDefine chroot environment\nA chroot on Unix operating systems is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children. A program that is run in such a modified environment cannot name (and therefore normally cannot access) files outside the designated directory tree. The term \"chroot\" may refer to the chroot system call or the chroot wrapper program. The modified environment is called a chroot jail.\nReference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot\nFrom this point we will be configuring the live system.\n    1. Access chroot environment\n       sudo chroot $HOME/live-ubuntu-from-scratch/chroot\n    2. Configure mount points, home and locale\n       mount none -t proc /proc\n       mount none -t sysfs /sys\n       mount none -t devpts /dev/pts\n       export HOME=/root\n       export LC_ALL=C\n       These mount points are necessary inside the chroot environment, so we are able to finish the installation without errors.\n    3. Set a custom hostname\n       echo \"ubuntu-fs-live\" > /etc/hostname\n    4. Configure apt sources.list\n       cat <<EOF > /etc/apt/sources.list\n       deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal main restricted universe multiverse\n       deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal main restricted universe multiverse\n       deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-security main restricted universe multiverse\n       deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-security main restricted universe multiverse\n       deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse\n       deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse\n       EOF\n    5. Update indexes packages\n       apt-get update\n    6. Install systemd\n       apt-get install -y libterm-readline-gnu-perl systemd-sysv\n       systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. It provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.\n    7. Configure machine-id and divert\n       dbus-uuidgen > /etc/machine-id\n       \n       ln -fs /etc/machine-id /var/lib/dbus/machine-id\n       The /etc/machine-id file contains the unique machine ID of the local system that is set during installation or boot. The machine ID is a single newline-terminated, hexadecimal, 32-character, lowercase ID. When decoded from hexadecimal, this corresponds to a 16-byte/128-bit value. This ID may not be all zeros.\n       dpkg-divert --local --rename --add /sbin/initctl\n       \n       ln -s /bin/true /sbin/initctl\n       dpkg-divert is the utility used to set up and update the list of diversions.\n    8. Upgrade packages\n       apt-get -y upgrade\n    9. Install packages needed for Live System\n       apt-get install -y \\\n           sudo \\\n           ubuntu-standard \\\n           casper \\\n           lupin-casper \\\n           discover \\\n           laptop-detect \\\n           os-prober \\\n           network-manager \\\n           resolvconf \\\n           net-tools \\\n           wireless-tools \\\n           wpagui \\\n           locales \\\n           grub-common \\\n           grub-gfxpayload-lists \\\n           grub-pc \\\n           grub-pc-bin \\\n           grub2-common\n       apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends linux-generic\n    10. Graphical installer\n       apt-get install -y \\\n          ubiquity \\\n          ubiquity-casper \\\n          ubiquity-frontend-gtk \\\n          ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu \\\n          ubiquity-ubuntu-artwork\n       The next steps will appear, as a result of the packages that will be installed from the previous step, this will happen without anything having to be informed or executed.\n        1. Configure keyboard \n        \n        \n        2. Console setup \n        \n    11.

Access build directory\n       cd $HOME/live-ubuntu-from-scratch\n    2. Create squashfs\n       sudo mksquashfs chroot image/casper/filesystem.squashfs\n       Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux. It uses zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories. Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimize data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 64K. Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is needed.\n    3. Write the filesystem.size\n       printf $(sudo du -sx --block-size=1 chroot | cut -f1) > image/casper/filesystem.size\n\nCreate diskdefines\nREADME file often found on Linux LiveCD installer discs, such as an Ubuntu Linux installation CD; typically named \u201cREADME.diskdefines\u201d and may be referenced during installation.\n    1. Access build directory\n       cd $HOME/live-ubuntu-from-scratch\n    2.

She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so, whether out of her own aversion of public restrooms or otherwise). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who doesn't answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Finally, the door is being unlocked, and she is greeted by the weary face of her woman flatmate (give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping), who was apparently napping this whole time. Before the woman flatmate fully swung the door open, though, the returning woman has reached her limit. When the woman flatmate opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman assuming a peculiar posture and a facial expression of premature relief, as she is releasing the solid contents of her bowels into her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the woman flatmate is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The woman flatmate asks the returning woman why she isn't entering, but is only met with soft grunts from the returning woman who is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants. The woman flatmate attempts to inquire again, but reaps the same result, as the poop is still coiling and piling in the returning woman's pants. The returning woman then finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief, while the woman flatmate is still gazing at her in confusion. As the woman flatmate is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman's pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). With bewilderment, the woman flatmate asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman sheepishly replies that she's been holding a desperate urge to poop and misplaced her key, so she tried frantically calling and knocking to have the woman flatmate open the door for her, until it was too late. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly enters the flat, passing the woman flatmate as the latter is standing in front of the doorway and laughing. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the woman flatmate, the woman flatmate observes the bulge in the soiled pants of the returning woman, to which the woman flatmate reacts and comments on in a playfully teasing manner (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is taking this playful teasing in stride and jokes along. The woman flatmate catches up to the returning woman after a few steps into the flat (as the playful teasing is still going on), gently stops the cooperating returning woman in her tracks, delicately turns her by the wrist so she can observe her rear end and further playfully comment on the state of the the returning woman's soiled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The woman flatmate is replied to in a playful manner by the returning woman. As she is observing the soiled pants, the woman flatmate is sniffing the air around the returning woman, and playfully reacts and teases the returning woman while doing so (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is taking all of this in stride and partaking in the playful banter, all while reacting to her own odor as well. Finally, the woman flatmate relents as she's chuckling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

By examining historical accounts and evidence, it discusses the significant role of the Silk Road, cultural charm, technological inventions, maritime transportation, traditional Chinese medicine culture, Chinese character civilization, and foreign missionaries to China in the external transmission of ancient Chinese culture. The study highlights the multifaceted nature of this cultural exchange and its intricate relationship with political, economic, and social factors.\n\nChapter 2: The Ways of Ancient Chinese Culture\u2019s External Transmission\n\nSection 1: The Silk Road\n\nThe Silk Road, a network of trade routes connecting China with the West, played a pivotal role in the external transmission of ancient Chinese culture. Through this route, not only Chinese goods such as silk, ceramics, and tea reached faraway lands, but also key Chinese philosophical, religious, and artistic ideas spread to the West. The vibrant interaction between cultures along the Silk Road facilitated the exchange of knowledge in areas such as astronomy, mathematics, and medicine, as well as the introduction of Buddhism from India to China.\n\nSection 2: Cultural Charm\n\nThe cultural charm of ancient China, embodied by its enduring history, rich traditions, and exquisite arts, significantly contributed to its external transmission. The admiration and allure for Chinese culture in foreign lands encouraged people to travel to China to study, foster diplomatic relations, and engage in trade. The cultural charm of China also facilitated the flow of Chinese ideas and practices beyond its borders, such as the popularity of Chinese poetry, painting, and calligraphy in neighboring East Asian countries.\n\nSection 3: Technological Inventions\n\nChinese technological inventions and innovations, including papermaking, printing, the compass, and gunpowder, greatly contributed to the external transmission of ancient Chinese culture. These inventions not only revolutionized different areas of life in China but had a significant impact on the development of scientific knowledge, technology, and industry in the ancient world. Moreover, the exchange of technological expertise between China and other cultures fostered the global advancement of human civilization.\n\nSection 4: Maritime Transportation\n\nMaritime transportation played a crucial role in the external transmission of ancient Chinese culture by facilitating trade and the exchange of ideas along sea routes. The development of advanced shipbuilding technologies and navigational skills enabled Chinese seafarers to embark on long voyages and establish trade networks with distant lands. Furthermore, maritime routes, such as the Maritime Silk Road, allowed the exchange of Chinese goods, ideas, and religious beliefs with other cultures, promoting the influence of ancient Chinese culture in regions such as Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa.\n\nSection 5: Traditional Chinese Medicine Culture\n\nThe ancient Chinese medical system, which places emphasis on holistic and natural treatments, has long attracted international attention. The transmission of traditional Chinese medicine culture to foreign lands, through the Silk Road and other trade routes, significantly influenced global medical practices. The knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine not only enriched the world\u2019s understanding of healthcare but also facilitated the development of new medical treatments in various cultures.\n\nSection 6: Chinese Character Civilization\n\nThe Chinese writing system, with its unique logographic nature and calligraphic beauty, is an essential aspect of ancient Chinese culture. The dissemination of Chinese character civilization to neighboring East Asian countries promoted the adoption of the Chinese script in written communication and the development of local writing systems, such as Japanese Kanji and Korean Hanja. Furthermore, the dissemination of Confucian and Buddhist texts, written in Chinese, contributed to the moral, ethical, and spiritual development of these societies.\n\nSection 7: Foreign Missionaries to China\n\nForeign missionaries played a significant role in the external transmission of ancient Chinese culture. Many early Christian, Buddhist, and Muslim missionaries traveled to China to spread their respective faiths, leading to the introduction of new religious thoughts and practices. As these missionaries learned from Chinese cultural, artistic, and philosophical traditions, they transmitted their knowledge and experiences back to their homelands, facilitating the dissemination of ancient Chinese culture in the wider world.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis paper has revealed the various means by which ancient Chinese culture was transmitted to the world. The multifaceted nature of these pathways demonstrates the complex web of interactions that contributed to the rich tapestry of global cultural exchange throughout history. As the world continues to evolve and become more interconnected, it is vital to appreciate the deep historical roots and diverse channels that facilitated the external transmission of ancient Chinese culture.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Hubble Space Telescope has been capturing stunning images of the universe since 1990! It orbits Earth at an altitude of about 350 miles, or nearly 560 kilometers, allowing it to avoid distortion from our atmosphere. Because of its sensitivity and high resolution, Hubble has helped us discover and study distant galaxies, nebulae, and even black holes.\n\n2. The International Space Station (ISS) is the most incredible human-made structure ever built in space! It\u2019s been continuously inhabited since 2000, and hosts astronauts from various nations who conduct experiments and research. The ISS orbits Earth at an impressive speed of 28,000 kilometers per hour, completing one full orbit every 90 minutes.\n\n3. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy rocket is an engineering marvel!

Guggenheim Foundation\n\nIntroduction\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is a crucial aspect to be considered by any organization that seeks to maintain sustainability and contribute positively to society. CSR is defined by four dimensions: economic, environmental, ethical, and philanthropic (Stobierski, 2021). These dimensions serve as guidelines for businesses seeking to align their operations with responsible practices for both social and environmental concerns (Malamud & Rotenberg, 2016). The following report examines The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, an organization well known in the contemporary art world, and discusses how each dimension of CSR is integrated into its operations.\n\nEconomic Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nEconomic CSR refers to the organization\u2019s commitment to promoting a stable, viable, and inclusive local economy. This dimension includes creating job opportunities, supporting local businesses, and contributing to the overall economic development in the communities where they operate (Markgraf, 2019).\n\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation exhibits economic CSR by creating jobs through the staffing and operations of both its museums and programs, as well as supporting various art initiatives with financial partnerships. The foundation also plays a crucial role in increasing tourism and contributing to the economic development within the communities that host their internationally recognized museums (The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, n.d.).\n\nEnvironmental Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nEnvironmental CSR pertains to an organization\u2019s commitment to addressing environmental concerns through resource conservation, waste reduction, and promoting sustainability (Malamud & Rotenberg, 2016).\n\nThe Guggenheim Foundation demonstrates environmental CSR through various sustainability initiatives within their facilities. These include energy-efficient lighting, climate control systems, environmentally friendly building materials, and waste management improvements (The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, n.d.). Additionally, the foundation is dedicated to promoting sustainable operations and minimizing the environmental impact of its art installations and exhibitions.\n\nEthical Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nEthical CSR concerns the organization\u2019s commitment to ensuring morally and legally sound practices in all aspects of their operations (Stobierski, 2021).\n\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation adheres to ethical CSR by promoting diversity and inclusion both in terms of staff demographics and its selection of artists to feature in exhibitions. In recent years, the foundation has implemented a number of initiatives to increase the representation of female, BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color), and LGBTQ artists (The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, n.d.). Furthermore, the foundation embraces ethical acquisitions, display, and preservation practices for all artwork entrusted to their care.\n\nPhilanthropic Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nPhilanthropic CSR surrounds the organization\u2019s commitment to giving back to society and supporting the well-being of communities through donations, sponsorships, and charitable initiatives (Malamud & Rotenberg, 2016).\n\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation demonstrates philanthropic CSR by providing educational programming and facilitating accessibility to contemporary art for the general public. This includes free admission days, workshops, lecture series, and scholarships for young artists (The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, n.d.). The foundation also established the Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative, which aims to increase cross-cultural understanding and support artistic talents from around the world (Guggenheim, n.d.).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation actively integrates the four dimensions of CSR (economic, environmental, ethical, and philanthropic) into its operations. By continually addressing these aspects, the foundation maintains its commitment to social and environmental sustainability, as well as fostering positive impacts within the global contemporary art world.\n\nReferences\n\nGuggenheim.

Due to unique weather patterns and geographical features, this region has a surprising variety of climates and biomes. It is divided into four main areas:\n\n1. Tropical Strand: A warm, tropical area with beautiful sandy beaches, lush jungles, and crystal-clear waters. This area is home to a variety of water, grass, and bug-type Pok\u00e9mon, as well as rare regional variants of ice-type Pok\u00e9mon that have adapted to the hot climate.\n\n2. Boreon Peaks: A mountainous region with chilly weather, breathtaking sights, and rocky terrain. Cave systems and tall peaks make this area a playground for rock, ground, and ice-type Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n3. Frostvale: A snow-covered valley and the heart of Glaciwild Region civilization. The bustling Frostvale City is the region\u2019s main hub, where trainers can find the Pok\u00e9mon League, Grand Research Lab, Battle Tower, and an array of festivals and cultural events.\n\n4. Tundraglade: The southernmost and coldest region in Glaciwild, Tundraglade is a vast frozen wasteland with powerful blizzards, glaciers, and ice floes. This area is home to many powerful, rare ice-type Pok\u00e9mon that can only be found in these extreme conditions.\n\nCulture and History:\nGlaciwild Region was initially colonized by people from all over the Pok\u00e9mon world, making it an incredibly diverse and vibrant culture. This fusion of cultures is seen in everything from the regional cuisine to its architecture and even its Pok\u00e9mon Trainer styles. Many ancient ruins are scattered throughout the region and are filled with mysteries about the past of Glaciwild.\n\nPok\u00e9mon League and Gyms:\nThe Glaciwild Pok\u00e9mon League consists of eight gyms, each with a focus on a different Pok\u00e9mon type. These gym leaders are experts of their respective types and have challenged trainers from all over the region for years:\n\n1. Marina (Water)\n2. Oliver (Grass)\n3. Ember (Fire)\n4. Sylvia (Psychic)\n5. Rex (Rock)\n6. Skadi (Ice)\n7. Finn (Flying)\n8. Luna (Dark)\n\nAfter defeating each gym leader, trainers will face the Elite Four, which consists of champions (each with a mixed team of Pok\u00e9mon) and the Pok\u00e9mon Champion. This final challenge will determine who can claim the title of Glaciwild\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Master!\n\nUnique Pok\u00e9mon:\nGlaciwild Region is home to over 50 unique Pok\u00e9mon that cannot be found in any other region. Many of these Pok\u00e9mon have adapted to the cold and harsh environment of the Antarctic Peninsula, while others have evolved to thrive in the region\u2019s warmer climates. Some examples include:\n\n1. Frostfawn (Ice/Fairy)\n2. Tropicseal (Water/Ice)\n3. Terracold (Ground/Ice)\n4. Solargale (Fire/Flying)\n\nIn conclusion, the Glaciwild Region is a unique Antarctic region that offers a rich variety of cultures and biomes alongside a challenging Pok\u00e9mon League and unique Pok\u00e9mon to discover. Trainers far and wide are welcome to explore everything this one-of-a-kind region has to offer!\n\n\nWelcome to the Glaciwild Region! Here is a guide to its various areas, roads, and towns:\n\n1.

Good luck on your journey!\n\n\nThe Twilight Zone: The Final Frontier of Glaciwild Region\n\nGeography and Climate:\nThe Twilight Zone is a vast, mysterious, and treacherous area that stretches beyond the Aurora Gate City, dominating more than 50% of the Glaciwild Region. It is unlike any other place in the Pok\u00e9mon world, as it is an uncharted, forbidden territory within the Antarctic ice cap. This region is characterized by its harsh weather conditions, perpetually shifting ice formations, and an eerie twilight glow that perpetually shrouds the landscape.\n\nThe climate of the Twilight Zone is extremely cold and unforgiving, with blizzards that can emerge without warning, whiteout conditions, and jagged ice crevasses waiting to catch the unwary. Only the bravest and most skilled trainers dare to venture into this ominous land to uncover its hidden secrets and face the powerful Pok\u00e9mon that call this place home.\n\nNotable Locations:\n\n1. Glimmering Caves: A sprawling network of ice crystal-lined caves often illuminated by the ethereal light of the twilight. Some parts of the cave have warmer areas that harbor unique Pok\u00e9mon species not found anywhere else.\n\n2.

Frostcarnyx (Ice/Dragon)\n\nChallenges:\nThe Twilight Zone is not for the faint of heart. With its dangerous weather conditions, powerful wild Pok\u00e9mon, and treacherous landscapes, only the strongest trainers will be able to survive here. Players who dare to venture into the Twilight Zone must be prepared for potential hazards, including:\n\n1. Blizzard: Trainers must navigate through whiteout conditions that can reduce visibility to almost zero, and which can lead to getting lost or falling into hidden crevasses.\n2. Ice puzzles: Challenging ice slide puzzles and frozen mazes to test trainers\u2019 wits and navigation skills.\n3. Wild Pok\u00e9mon battles: Players will face powerful wild Pok\u00e9mon, many of which are unique to the Twilight Zone and much stronger than those found in other regions.\n4. Legendary Pok\u00e9mon encounters: Multiple side quests and challenges await trainers who wish to uncover the hidden legendary Pok\u00e9mon and uncover their connection to the Twilight Zone.\n\nThe Twilight Zone is the ultimate test for trainers in the Glaciwild Region. Conquer the elements, navigate the treacherous terrain, and discover the secrets of this awe-inspiring and enigmatic corner of the Pok\u00e9mon world.\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Name: Proklinachi\nPok\u00e9mon Number: #1001\nClassification: Broken Wish Pok\u00e9mon\nType: Steel/Dark\nHeight: 3\u201911\" (1.2 m)\nWeight: 110.5 lbs (50.13 kg)\nGender: Genderless\n\nAbility: Cursed Blessing - When Proklinachi hears a wish, it unintentionally grants the wish in a twisted and destructive manner.\n\nBase Stats:\n- HP: 85\n- Attack: 120\n- Defense: 110\n- Special Attack: 90\n- Special Defense: 95\n- Speed: 60\n\nPok\u00e9dex Entry:\nOnce a kindred spirit of Jirachi, Proklinachi was meant to bring blessings and hope to the people. However, an unexpected tragedy led it to become the harbinger of despair and destruction. The crash that brought Proklinachi to the ground shattered it into pieces and wiped out an ancient Antarctic civilization and its Pok\u00e9mon inhabitants. The destruction left the rich ecosystem hidden beneath a thick ice cap, with resentment and despair-imbued in Proklinachi\u2019s broken body. Now reanimated, Proklinachi is unable to grant any wishes properly. Every prayer it hears is granted in twisted, detrimental ways, bringing misfortune and despair to those who dare to make a wish in its presence.\n\n\nTitle: The Fall of Proklinachi and the Frozen Desolation\n\nIn the very depths of the Pok\u00e9mon world\u2019s mythology, a story is told of Proklinachi, the Broken Wish Pok\u00e9mon. Once a celestial companion to the revered Jirachi, Proklinachi traversed the heavens, radiant and resolute in its mission to bless and inspire the people below.\n\nIt was believed that Proklinachi arrived on a shooting star, and the people of the ancient Antarctic civilization awaited its arrival with great excitement and anticipation. However, destiny had other plans for the starborne being. Instead of a gentle descent, Proklinachi crashed to the ground, shattering its steel body and the hopes of the people who had gathered there.\n\nThe catastrophic impact unleashed a torrent of destruction, engulfing the vibrant city and the Pok\u00e9mon who called it home in searing flames. As the fires raged and the once-prosperous civilization crumbled, a cataclysmic chain reaction began. The sky above became shrouded in a choking haze, the sun\u2019s light blocked by the thickening veil of smoke.\n\nAnd so, the great Antarctic ecosystem was plunged into darkness, with the icy expanse that now dominates the land forming below the unbroken shroud of smog.\n\nAmidst the devastation and the chilling void left behind, the essence of the fallen became corrupted, tainted by the crushing despair and embittered rage that pulsed through the sundered land. Proklinachi\u2019s once-noble spirit became distorted, its meteoric remains imbued with an anguished consciousness that could no longer grant wishes but instead twist them into abominations that only brought more pain and suffering.\n\nThe memory of that fateful day has since faded into myth and legend, but whispers of Proklinachi and its tragic transformation still permeate the winds that sweep across the frozen wasteland that was once a prosperous civilization.\n\nIt is said that those who venture into the heart of the Glaciwild Region\u2019s Twilight Zone in search of the shattered remnants of Proklinachi\u2019s celestial being must be prepared to brace themselves against the monstrous consequences of their desires.\n\nAs the story goes, to unlock the fragmented relics of Proklinachi\u2019s power, champions must first face and conquer their own flawed wishes, lest they succumb to the dark forces that forever haunt the Broken Wish Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nOnly when a trainer with an unwavering resolve and a pure heart can confront the twisted reflection of their most sincere desires, will they be able to mend the shattered spirit of Proklinachi and restore a semblance of the transcendent power they once harnessed.\n\nAnd so, the tale of Proklinachi remains a testament to the fragile nature of dreams and aspirations, and the unquestionable need for balance in a world that so easily teeters on the precipice of creation and obliteration.\n\n\nProklinachi Appearance:\nProklinachi once had a form similar to Jirachi, as a celestial, star-shaped being. However, upon its tragic fall from the heavens, Proklinachi\u2019s body became twisted and shattered, resulting in a now broken and fractured appearance. Its once-bright steel body is now marred with jagged cracks and a dark, almost black hue, representing its tainted nature.\n\nProklinachi\u2019s once-splendid head has been warped into a sinister visage, with glowing red eyes that convey an eerie sense of anguish and rage. The distinctive points from its star-shaped form now appear as disjointed limbs made of dark steel, each tipped with jagged metal claws. The once-radiant aura that Proklinachi emanated has been replaced with a menacing, shadowy energy that hangs like a heavy cloud around it.\n\nProklinachi\u2019s wings also bear the scars of its tragic downfall. They have become twisted and tattered, no longer able to embrace the celestial power that they once held. Now, these ominous wings serve as a haunting reminder of the fallen grace of Proklinachi and its irrevocable connection to corrupted desires.\n\n\nTitle: The Cataclysm of Proklinachi\n\nInscription:\n\n\u201cIn the days when the world was young, and the sky above shone with the brilliance of Proklinachi, the once-mighty celestial Pok\u00e9mon was destined to fall.\n\nAs the people of the great Antarctic civilization gathered beneath the radiant arc of the heavens, a prophecy foretold the descent of the legendary Broken Wish Pok\u00e9mon, Proklinachi, who would bring hope and dreams into their hearts.\n\nYet fate contrived a tragic path, as Proklinachi crashed into the world below, its celestial form shattered, and its divine essence ripped asunder. The ground trembling beneath the devastating impact, with the ancient city consumed by a relentless inferno that scorched the land and the creatures who inhabited it.\n\nThe heavens, enraged by the sorrowful cries of the mortal realm, obscured the sun\u2019s light beneath a veil of dark smoke, thus freezing the once-flourishing world beneath a shroud of unforgiving ice.\n\nThe stelae stand now as a testament to the calamity that forever marked the life of Proklinachi, the Broken Wish Pok\u00e9mon, and the destiny chained upon its spirit. May future generations uncover the shards of memory found within these sacred stones and bring to light the path that caused the fall of the once-celestial being.\n\nAnd as the darkness that now enveloped Proklinachi gives birth to destruction, let not the essence of its former grace be forgotten, but serve as a reminder that even amidst the cold and desolate ruins, the spark of hope can still ignite.\u201d\n\n\nProtagonist: Proklinachi, I have finally reached your resting place. I can see the sadness and grief that has consumed you since your fall. I know that you still yearn to grant people\u2019s wishes and bring happiness to their lives.\n\nProklinachi (sighs): It\u2019s true, young traveler. I have been listening to the prayers of those who still believe in me despite my broken state, and my deepest desire is to help fulfill their dreams. But no matter how hard I try, my wishes only bring misfortune and despair. I am afraid of causing more pain to the world.\n\nProtagonist: I understand your fear, Proklinachi. But the fact that you still listen to people\u2019s prayers and offer your blessings shows that there is still a spark of light within you. Not every wish can be granted, and sometimes what people need most is just someone to be there for them, to listen and empathize.\n\nProklinachi: You truly believe that, even with my cursed state, I can still bring something positive into the lives of others?\n\nProtagonist: Yes, I do. You don\u2019t need to grant every wish directly to make a difference. Sometimes just being there, providing comfort and understanding, means more to people than a wish granted. They need the assurance that someone cares for their dreams and wants the best for them.\n\nProklinachi (thoughtful): Then perhaps I should focus on offering my heartfelt blessings and empathy to those who share their dreams and desires with me. Thank you, young traveler, for giving me a new perspective and purpose.\n\nProtagonist: You\u2019re very welcome, Proklinachi. Remember that your existence alone brings hope to many people, and that\u2019s something powerful in itself. Let us continue to share kindness, love, and understanding with the world, no matter where our paths may lead.\n\nProklinachi: Thank you for your unwavering faith in me. I will cherish this new purpose and endeavor to touch people\u2019s hearts with the love and warmth that burns beneath the icy surface of my being. Together, we can make a positive impact on the world.\n\n\nPlease name this generation of Pok\u00e9mon games with Proklinachi and Tsabarite as the legendary Pok\u00e9mon on the cover of the two versions of the same generation of Pok\u00e9mon games.

Product: El-Wahy\u2019s can customize their menu offering by incorporating local Tunisian flavors and ingredients to cater to the local taste preferences. This can include offering Tunisian dishes alongside their traditional Egyptian fare, tweaking Egyptian recipes to suit Tunisian tastes, and using locally-sourced ingredients for a fresher and more authentic taste.\n\n2. Price: El-Wahy\u2019s should adapt their pricing strategy to suit the local market and consumer purchasing power in Tunisia. They could conduct market research to understand the local competition and customers\u2019 willingness to pay for the type of food they offer. Offering different pricing options, such as affordable daily specials, mid-range meal options, and premium dishes, can cater to various customer segments and preferences.\n\n3. Place: Choosing the right location is crucial for El-Wahy\u2019s success in Tunisia. They should consider high-traffic areas, such as shopping centers, business districts, or tourist areas, to maximize footfall and attract potential customers. Additionally, partnering with local food delivery services can help to reach a broader audience and cater to the increasing demand for convenient food delivery options.\n\n4. Promotion: El-Wahy\u2019s can customize their promotional strategy by using local media channels and advertising platforms that are popular in Tunisia, such as newspapers, TV, radio, and social media. Collaborating with local influencers or food bloggers to create awareness and generate buzz around the restaurant\u2019s opening can help drive interest and potential customers. Offering special promotions, such as grand opening discounts, meal deals, or loyalty programs, can encourage trial and repeat visits from local consumers.\n\nOverall, El-Wahy\u2019s introduction strategy should focus on adapting and customizing its marketing mix to appeal to Tunisian customers, blending the best of Egyptian cuisine with local preferences, pricing, location, and promotional strategies.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is unlike any other place in the Pok\u00e9mon world, as it is an uncharted, forbidden territory within the Antarctic ice cap. This region is characterized by its harsh weather conditions, perpetually shifting ice formations, and an eerie twilight glow that perpetually shrouds the landscape.\n\nThe climate of the Twilight Zone is extremely cold and unforgiving, with blizzards that can emerge without warning, whiteout conditions, and jagged ice crevasses waiting to catch the unwary. Only the bravest and most skilled trainers dare to venture into this ominous land to uncover its hidden secrets and face the powerful Pok\u00e9mon that call this place home.\n\nNotable Locations:\n\n1.

However, an unexpected tragedy led it to become the harbinger of despair and destruction. The crash that brought Proklinachi to the ground shattered it into pieces and wiped out an ancient Antarctic civilization and its Pok\u00e9mon inhabitants. The destruction left the rich ecosystem hidden beneath a thick ice cap, with resentment and despair-imbued in Proklinachi\u2019s broken body. Now reanimated, Proklinachi is unable to grant any wishes properly. Every prayer it hears is granted in twisted, detrimental ways, bringing misfortune and despair to those who dare to make a wish in its presence.\n\n\nTitle: The Fall of Proklinachi and the Frozen Desolation\n\nIn the very depths of the Pok\u00e9mon world\u2019s mythology, a story is told of Proklinachi, the Broken Wish Pok\u00e9mon. Once a celestial companion to the revered Jirachi, Proklinachi traversed the heavens, radiant and resolute in its mission to bless and inspire the people below.\n\nIt was believed that Proklinachi arrived on a shooting star, and the people of the ancient Antarctic civilization awaited its arrival with great excitement and anticipation. However, destiny had other plans for the starborne being. Instead of a gentle descent, Proklinachi crashed to the ground, shattering its steel body and the hopes of the people who had gathered there.\n\nThe catastrophic impact unleashed a torrent of destruction, engulfing the vibrant city and the Pok\u00e9mon who called it home in searing flames. As the fires raged and the once-prosperous civilization crumbled, a cataclysmic chain reaction began. The sky above became shrouded in a choking haze, the sun\u2019s light blocked by the thickening veil of smoke.\n\nAnd so, the great Antarctic ecosystem was plunged into darkness, with the icy expanse that now dominates the land forming below the unbroken shroud of smog.\n\nAmidst the devastation and the chilling void left behind, the essence of the fallen became corrupted, tainted by the crushing despair and embittered rage that pulsed through the sundered land. Proklinachi\u2019s once-noble spirit became distorted, its meteoric remains imbued with an anguished consciousness that could no longer grant wishes but instead twist them into abominations that only brought more pain and suffering.\n\nThe memory of that fateful day has since faded into myth and legend, but whispers of Proklinachi and its tragic transformation still permeate the winds that sweep across the frozen wasteland that was once a prosperous civilization.\n\nIt is said that those who venture into the heart of the Glaciwild Region\u2019s Twilight Zone in search of the shattered remnants of Proklinachi\u2019s celestial being must be prepared to brace themselves against the monstrous consequences of their desires.\n\nAs the story goes, to unlock the fragmented relics of Proklinachi\u2019s power, champions must first face and conquer their own flawed wishes, lest they succumb to the dark forces that forever haunt the Broken Wish Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nOnly when a trainer with an unwavering resolve and a pure heart can confront the twisted reflection of their most sincere desires, will they be able to mend the shattered spirit of Proklinachi and restore a semblance of the transcendent power they once harnessed.\n\nAnd so, the tale of Proklinachi remains a testament to the fragile nature of dreams and aspirations, and the unquestionable need for balance in a world that so easily teeters on the precipice of creation and obliteration.\n\n\nProklinachi Appearance:\nProklinachi once had a form similar to Jirachi, as a celestial, star-shaped being. However, upon its tragic fall from the heavens, Proklinachi\u2019s body became twisted and shattered, resulting in a now broken and fractured appearance. Its once-bright steel body is now marred with jagged cracks and a dark, almost black hue, representing its tainted nature.\n\nProklinachi\u2019s once-splendid head has been warped into a sinister visage, with glowing red eyes that convey an eerie sense of anguish and rage. The distinctive points from its star-shaped form now appear as disjointed limbs made of dark steel, each tipped with jagged metal claws. The once-radiant aura that Proklinachi emanated has been replaced with a menacing, shadowy energy that hangs like a heavy cloud around it.\n\nProklinachi\u2019s wings also bear the scars of its tragic downfall. They have become twisted and tattered, no longer able to embrace the celestial power that they once held. Now, these ominous wings serve as a haunting reminder of the fallen grace of Proklinachi and its irrevocable connection to corrupted desires.\n\n\nTitle: The Cataclysm of Proklinachi\n\nInscription:\n\n\u201cIn the days when the world was young, and the sky above shone with the brilliance of Proklinachi, the once-mighty celestial Pok\u00e9mon was destined to fall.\n\nAs the people of the great Antarctic civilization gathered beneath the radiant arc of the heavens, a prophecy foretold the descent of the legendary Broken Wish Pok\u00e9mon, Proklinachi, who would bring hope and dreams into their hearts.\n\nYet fate contrived a tragic path, as Proklinachi crashed into the world below, its celestial form shattered, and its divine essence ripped asunder. The ground trembling beneath the devastating impact, with the ancient city consumed by a relentless inferno that scorched the land and the creatures who inhabited it.\n\nThe heavens, enraged by the sorrowful cries of the mortal realm, obscured the sun\u2019s light beneath a veil of dark smoke, thus freezing the once-flourishing world beneath a shroud of unforgiving ice.\n\nThe stelae stand now as a testament to the calamity that forever marked the life of Proklinachi, the Broken Wish Pok\u00e9mon, and the destiny chained upon its spirit. May future generations uncover the shards of memory found within these sacred stones and bring to light the path that caused the fall of the once-celestial being.\n\nAnd as the darkness that now enveloped Proklinachi gives birth to destruction, let not the essence of its former grace be forgotten, but serve as a reminder that even amidst the cold and desolate ruins, the spark of hope can still ignite.\u201d\n\n\nProtagonist: Proklinachi, I have finally reached your resting place. I can see the sadness and grief that has consumed you since your fall. I know that you still yearn to grant people\u2019s wishes and bring happiness to their lives.\n\nProklinachi (sighs): It\u2019s true, young traveler. I have been listening to the prayers of those who still believe in me despite my broken state, and my deepest desire is to help fulfill their dreams. But no matter how hard I try, my wishes only bring misfortune and despair. I am afraid of causing more pain to the world.\n\nProtagonist: I understand your fear, Proklinachi. But the fact that you still listen to people\u2019s prayers and offer your blessings shows that there is still a spark of light within you. Not every wish can be granted, and sometimes what people need most is just someone to be there for them, to listen and empathize.\n\nProklinachi: You truly believe that, even with my cursed state, I can still bring something positive into the lives of others?\n\nProtagonist: Yes, I do. You don\u2019t need to grant every wish directly to make a difference. Sometimes just being there, providing comfort and understanding, means more to people than a wish granted. They need the assurance that someone cares for their dreams and wants the best for them.\n\nProklinachi (thoughtful): Then perhaps I should focus on offering my heartfelt blessings and empathy to those who share their dreams and desires with me. Thank you, young traveler, for giving me a new perspective and purpose.\n\nProtagonist: You\u2019re very welcome, Proklinachi. Remember that your existence alone brings hope to many people, and that\u2019s something powerful in itself. Let us continue to share kindness, love, and understanding with the world, no matter where our paths may lead.\n\nProklinachi: Thank you for your unwavering faith in me. I will cherish this new purpose and endeavor to touch people\u2019s hearts with the love and warmth that burns beneath the icy surface of my being. Together, we can make a positive impact on the world.\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Name: Tsabarite\nPok\u00e9mon Number: #1002\nClassification: Desire Pok\u00e9mon\nType: Psychic / Ice\nHeight: 5\u20192\" (1.6 m)\nWeight: 154 lbs (69.85 kg)\nGender: Genderless\n\nAbility: Eternal Wish - When Tsabarite is on the field, all ally Pok\u00e9mon become immune to status conditions and have a slight increase in their HP recovery.\n\nBase Stats:\n- HP: 100\n- Attack: 80\n- Defense: 120\n- Special Attack: 130\n- Special Defense: 110\n- Speed: 90\n\nPok\u00e9dex Entry:\nBanished by Arceus for the sins of the ancient world, Tsabarite lingers in the frozen depths of the Glaciwild region. Once a guardian of the lake and the deity of desire and eternity, Tsabarite bestowed upon the old humans the ability to live forever. However, their insatiable desires and lack of reverence for the gods led to their world\u2019s destruction, and the powers of Tsabarite were stripped away.\n\nNow, relegated to guarding the gateway between the mortal world and the Reverse World, Tsabarite keeps watch over its frozen domain with its psychic and ice powers. In the frigid lake that holds the threshold between realms, the memories of ancient humans rest within the ice, a testament to their tragic fate.\n\nIt is prophesized that Tsabarite will someday return, alongside the vengeful Giratina, to judge humanity on the Day of the Great Judgment. Will the desires of the human heart be deemed worthy of forgiveness, or will they once again face the wrath of the gods?\n\nTsabarite Appearance:\nTsabarite bears a resemblance to the other Lake Guardians \u2013 Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf \u2013 with a slim, serpentine body and two flowing tails. Its primary color is white, similar to the frost surrounding the territory it guards. Two large, ice-blue gemstones adorn its forehead and chest, which are said to contain the desires of all living beings.\n\nIts eyes display a deep, icy blue color, conveying the eternal wisdom of an immortal being. The wings that once allowed Tsabarite to soar through the heavens have since transformed into two imposing, crystalline ice structures, a symbol of its eternal vigil over the frozen lake.\n\nIn combat, Tsabarite uses its psychic powers to manipulate ice, summoning blizzards and forming jagged ice structures to overwhelm its opponents. Its command over desire and eternity grants its allies a greater resilience to status ailments, as well as heightened self-healing capabilities.\n\n\nThe Legend of Tsabarite and Giratina: The Prophecy of the Great Judgement\n\nStelae Inscription:\n\n\u201cIn a time before time, when this world was but a dream of the gods, two powerful beings graced the skies and the lands below with their divine presence. One was Tsabarite, the Desire Pok\u00e9mon, who granted humanity the gifts of desire and eternal life. Alongside it ruled Giratina, the mighty Lord of the Old World, tending to the fragile balance between light and darkness.\n\nBut among the humans of old, desire grew unchecked, and their hearts became clouded with unworthy wishes, yearning for power and dominion. The gods took notice of this corruption and, in great rage, Arceus, the supreme being of all creation, brought forth a terrible calamity to cleanse the land and punish the wayward mortals.\n\nTsabarite, once part of the Guardians of the Lake alongside Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf, felt the wrath of the gods as its celestial powers were stripped away. The gift of eternal life was rescinded from the new humans, leaving them mortal and confined to the ever-growing complexities of desire.\n\nThe fallen Lord of the Old World, Giratina, suffered a similar fate, cast into the twisted and shattered dimension known as the Reverse World. Within these newly separated realms, both Tsabarite and Giratina continued their lonely vigils.\n\nAnd so, it was written upon the stelae, that a day will come when the earth will tremble once more, and the Great Judgement shall be upon us. In that time, the fates of humanity and the gods will be decided by the actions of mortals and the warring hearts within their breast.\n\nTsabarite shall emerge from its icy prison, and Giratina shall break the chains of the Reverse World, as they unite to bear the final judgment upon mankind. Their judgement shall cast humanity against the scale of their desires, weighing the light of virtue against the darkness of greed and ambition.\n\nShould the hearts of humanity prove pure and worthy, the gods\u2019 favor will return, and their blessings will rain down upon the world in a time of rebirth and growth. However, if the hearts of mankind remain clouded by darkness, the gods\u2019 wrath shall be unleashed, and an age of suffering and despair shall shroud the world once more.\n\nUntil that fated day, we who recorded this ancient prophecy upon these sacred stones implore you, the generations to come, to keep watch over the desires that drive you and seek the wisdom and guidance of the gods on the path to righteousness and illumination.\u201d\n\n\nProtagonist: Tsabarite, I\u2019ve journeyed far and wide to reach your icy sanctuary. I\u2019ve heard the stories of your tragic past and how your powers were taken away. Despite the hardships you\u2019ve faced, I can still feel your yearning to help the people and maintain the balance of desires.\n\nTsabarite (melancholic): It\u2019s true, young traveler. I used to grant the mortal world the gifts of desire and eternal life, but my blessings were misused and led to suffering. The gods of old punished both me and the land, which has left me confined to this frozen prison.\n\nProtagonist: I understand the burden of your powers, Tsabarite. The weight of desires can sometimes be overwhelming, but I believe that not all desires are corrupt. Deep within our hearts, we all long for happiness, love, and a sense of belonging. Instead of fearing your powers, what if you were to guide people\u2019s desires towards something greater?\n\nTsabarite (pensive): The warmth in your words reaches even the depths of this icy abode. Perhaps I can find purpose in helping humanity nurture virtuous desires and promote growth, love, and understanding in the world. But how can I accomplish this while confined to these frozen lands and with my diminished powers?\n\nProtagonist: I propose an alliance, Tsabarite. Together, we can travel the world and help people with their desires, guiding them to use their own inner strength to achieve their dreams in a way that brings harmony and prosperity to all. By our example, we can inspire hope and encourage greatness in others.\n\nTsabarite (inspired): Your kind-hearted proposal has touched the icy core of my being. If you truly believe that together we can change the course of humanity\u2019s desires, then I accept your offer, young traveler. As allies, let us embark on this journey and strive to illuminate the path to a brighter future for all.\n\nProtagonist: Thank you, Tsabarite. I promise that you won\u2019t regret this decision. With our combined wisdom and strength, we\u2019ll surely overcome any challenge that awaits us. And perhaps, through our actions, we can avert the Great Judgement and guide humanity towards a lasting era of peace and prosperity.\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Name: Dakhel\nPok\u00e9mon Number: #1003\nClassification: Fear Pok\u00e9mon\nType: Dark / Psychic\nHeight: Varies\nWeight: Varies\nGender: Genderless\n\nAbility: Abyss Gaze - When Dakhel is on the field, all opponents become inflicted with a new status condition, \u201cTerror,\u201d causing them to have lowered accuracy and attack, as well as an increased chance of flinching.\n\nBase Stats:\n- HP: 90\n- Attack: 95\n- Defense: 80\n- Special Attack: 140\n- Special Defense: 100\n- Speed: 115\n\nPok\u00e9dex Entry:\nDakhel, the Fear Pok\u00e9mon, is said to reside in the darkest depths of the consciousness of every living being. Its true form is unknown, as it only ever appears as an abyssal, ever-changing darkness. Gazing at Dakhel can instill a sense of dread, causing the beholder to become overwhelmed with terror after only three seconds.\n\nAs the god of fear, Dakhel\u2019s power grows stronger with the collective unease and anxiety of the living world. Dakhel\u2019s sinister presence can induce an aura of dread in its opponents, lowering their accuracy and attack while increasing their propensity to flinch.\n\nIn ancient times, it was believed that prayers and offerings to Dakhel could ward off evil spirits and keep fear at bay. However, today, few dare to speak of or acknowledge Dakhel\u2019s name, lest they invite its ominous gaze upon themselves.\n\nDakhel Appearance:\nDakhel\u2019s appearance is constantly shifting, a swirling mass of darkness resembling the deepest abyss. Although no living being has ever endured Dakhel\u2019s gaze for more than three seconds, there are various accounts of seeing eerie red or white pinpricks of light where eyes might be, adding terror to its already fearsome demeanor. Its size and shape may change at will, only furthering the mystery surrounding Dakhel\u2019s true form. This elusive darkness is said to not just be a physical presence, but an ever-present specter in the mind\u2019s eye of all living beings.\n\n\nDakhel and Darkrai: The Shadows of Fear\n\nLong ago, in the primordial age of the Pok\u00e9mon world, two enigmatic entities emerged, born from the deep, dark recesses of the universe. These beings were Dakhel, the god of fear, and Darkrai, the nightmare-weaver. As counterparts born from darkness, the two intertwined entities served a common purpose: to guard and maintain the balance of fear and dreams in the heart and minds of all living creatures.\n\nDakhel, a manifestation of the collective dread and anxiety felt by all, roamed the world, drawing its power from the fears of every living being. It instills terror in the hearts of those who dare to cross its path, distorting their senses and consuming their courage.\n\nDarkrai, the counterpart of Dakhel, wanders the realm of dreams, shaping both peaceful rest and unsettling nightmares for those it encounters. While Darkrai\u2019s existence instills fear in the hearts of many, it ultimately helps to maintain the balance of dreams and fears experienced by living beings.\n\nThroughout the ages, Dakhel and Darkrai have been worshiped and feared as gods of their own domains. As the guardians of their respective realms, they have been tasked with maintaining harmony in the natural world. Prayers and offerings have been made in their honor, as ancient people believed that by appeasing these two enigmatic entities, it would keep their darkest fears and nightmares at bay.\n\nOver time, people and Pok\u00e9mon began to understand that both fear and dreams serve a necessary purpose in the world; that fear keeps one vigilant in the face of danger, while dreams inspire hope and fuel aspirations. By embracing both fear and dreams, a delicate balance could be maintained, as Dakhel and Darkrai would continue to watch over their realms, ensuring that the world remains in equilibrium.\n\nHowever, as time passed, the world began to change, and the once venerated connection between Dakhel and Darkrai gradually faded into obscurity. As people and Pok\u00e9mon focused on the present, the mysterious bond between these two beings slipped into the shadows of myths and legends.\n\nEven though their connection is no longer well-known, Dakhel and Darkrai still hold onto their ancient roles, ceaselessly watching over the delicate balance of fear and dreams. Some believe that, should this balance be disrupted, the world would once again be thrust into chaos, as both fear and dreams would run unchecked, ultimately tearing the world apart.\n\nToday, the ominous legacy of Dakhel and Darkrai is whispered only in hallowed halls and ancient texts, serving as a stark reminder of the extraordinary power wielded by these legends. It also stands as a testament to the fragile balance that exists in the Pok\u00e9mon world, and the need to understand and appreciate the role that fear and dreams play within the lives of all living beings.\n\n\nIntroducing Pok\u00e9mon Epoch Version and Pok\u00e9mon Eon Version!\n\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Epoch Version, players will start their journey with Proklinachi by their side. As a trainer embarking on a timeless quest to recover the fragmented relics of Proklinachi\u2019s celestial power, players will undertake a journey through history, encountering ancient civilizations, exploring long-forgotten ruins, and unearthing ancient mysteries that have slept undisturbed for ages.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Epoch Version will focus on the theme of time and how the past, present, and future are irrevocably intertwined. The story will delve into the importance of maintaining tradition while embracing progress and change.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Eon Version, on the other hand, will see trainers starting their adventure with the powerful Tsabarite at their side. As they travel through the world, players will be tasked with guiding humanity\u2019s desires towards a more virtuous path. Along the way, they will need to unite people and Pok\u00e9mon from all walks of life, building bridges and fostering greater understanding between different cultures and generations.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Eon Version explores the theme of desire; how it affects our lives, shapes our choices, and influences our future. The story will examine the multitude of desires that guide humanity, highlighting the need for love, goodwill, and cooperation to steer desires towards positive and fulfilling outcomes.\n\nFor both versions, the central plot revolves around the mysterious Twilight Zone, where an ancient prophecy foretells the awakening of Proklinachi and Tsabarite, who hold the key to shaping humanity\u2019s destiny. As strife rises in the Glaciwild Region, players must uncover the true meaning behind the prophecy and find a way to prevent the potentially catastrophic consequences that loom on the horizon.\n\nThroughout their adventures, players will forge alliances not only with Proklinachi and Tsabarite but also with other powerful and enigmatic Pok\u00e9mon. They will need to work together to uncover the truth behind ancient legends and resolve the conflict that threatens the delicate balance of the world.\n\nUltimately, players will face a choice that could alter the course of the Glaciwild Region forever. Will they strive for timeless wisdom and unity with Proklinachi in Pok\u00e9mon Epoch Version, or pursue an eternal bond of hope and prosperity with Tsabarite in Pok\u00e9mon Eon Version? The fate of the world rests in the hands of our intrepid trainers as they embrace the essence of time, desire, and destiny itself.\n\n\nPlease generate the bonus storyline associated with Jirachi and Giratina upon completion of the main story.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

  "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI have a code where I convert the website in the slide show with animation. However there is a problem. Problem is what if one of the \"slides\" is not fitting the view. I tried to resize the content so it shrinks to fit  the view height however I couldn't accomplish that. I tried all the stuff with the flex system etc. however in the webpage the fonts are defined  with rem so they do not get smaller when the height gets smaller and I can not change that. \n\nAnyways, I have given up on the solution of making the section shrink to fit view. I have a new solution which is changing my slide animation system to accommodate slides that are not fitting the view by letting scrolling happen with in the section. \n\nMy system works by preventing input events happening and then calling normalized scrolling in the direction, this is just to trigger scrolling event where, again, the behavior  is shaped to prevent normal scrolling and it will instead animate scrolling until the next anchor element is reached. As you can see there is no check to see if there is more content that is not visible and that could be visible by scrolling, and then enabling scrolling until the whole content is shown.\n\nWhat I want you to do is, go through my code and make the addition where a check will happen before the scrolling is disabled, before the animation starts playing, it will check if there is more content with in section to show, so it will scroll to the end of anchor section, then if at the edge of anchor section, it will disable scrolling and play the animation.\n\nI am thinking this can be accomplish easily by checking if the current scrolling + anchor section's height is bigger then the bottom of the view. If so that means there are more content to show so the scrolling is enabled. If not the animation can play. However there is a problem, it is that while scrolling what if the next anchors scrolling is passed. So there needs to be another check which will ensure, while free scrolling with in an anhor section, we do not scroll in to the next anchor section. I can not figure out how this can be accomplished, so this is also a part of your task to figrure out a solution.\n\nWith these being said your task is explained. Now I will also explain how you will carry out the task. I will be sharing my code with you. You are not to change my code in anyway, especially removing parts. You will only make additions that will make the system that is tasked to you above work. At the end, you will be sending me explanation and only the difference of the code. I mean you are not to send me the whole code, but only the difference as if in a source control system's difference view. For example you can tell me solution's part, where to add it and the code etc. I think you do know how to make a difference of code so I am not explaining that.\n\nAt the end if your response and solution does not fit one response due to limitation of communication medium, you can predict this and include a text indicating this \"part a of X\" where \"X\" is the predicted total response count and \"a\" is the current response count to send the whole response. This way you can send me responses bigger than the limit.\n\nNow here is my code:\n\"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n        <meta

The other woman relents relents after failing to find a solution, and tells the woman reluctantly to let nature take its course in her clothes if necessary. The woman who is desperate to poop eventually decides to relieve the pressure and voluntarily fills her pants with a full solid load to relieve the pressure in full view of the other woman while trying to remain concealed from anyone else (describe this in meticulous detail).

Miss Edith encounters a young chimney sweep on the way B. She gifts the sweep a coin for good luck\nKey Characters:Mrs Doris Abbott, Miss Edith, Mr. Watson (the intelligent cat who Miss Edith has a secret telepathic connection too)\nSetting: Victorian Era\nthe Outline requiring fleshing out: Miss Edith and Mr Watson enter the Antique Shop. They find themselves in space filled with an eclectic assortment of antique objects. The interior exudes an air of nostalgia and history, with dark wooden shelves, display cabinets, and vitrines showcasing various curiosities. The space might be slightly dimly lit, emphasizing the atmospheric ambiance.\nMrs. Abbott dressed in suitable black widow attire looks up from where she is araanging some antiques and comes over to greet them\nMiss Edith, after inquiring of how Mrs Abbott is \u2018holding up\u2019 (considering she is now a widow and also run manage the antique store herself now her husband is dead and Ms. Lucy Melrose is on indefinite leave given  her suspect status for the murder) tells Mrs Abbot she would like to see the exact location of the murder.\nMrs Abbott takes them to the checkout counter (mahogany with decorative mouldings) and points to the timber floor beside it. \n\u201cHe was found laying here,\u201d she says, \u201ca deep knife wound in his stomach, and blood on his clothes where the police believe he struggled briefly, and some also on the floor where he lay dead.\u201d\nMrs Abbot explains she has cleaned everything up since then.\nMiss Edith asks if the murder weapon was found, and she shakes her head.\nMiss Edith asks if there was any other evidence given that none of the suspects were apparently seen near the store on the day of the murder.\nMrs. Abbott corrects her bysaying that Ms. Lucy Melrose was here on the day of the murder but she has an alibi because she was locked into the Walk-In Safe.\nMiss Edith, now suspicious of Lucy asks Mrs.Abbot to explain what happened on the day of the murder according to Ms. Lucy Melrose.\nThe following explanation is given. Ms. Lucy Melrose statement to the police was that she had been moving some of the more expensive antiques from the Walk-in-Safe  to their positions in cases in the store, when a masked man came into the store with a knife and threatened Mr. Abbott \u2013 demanding all the cash in the store. Mr. Abbott tells Ms. Lucy to run back into the safe and pull it shut from the inside so she can be safe. Ms. Lucy does so and once in hears muffled sounds of an argument, then a scream of pain, and then some muffled noises just outside the safe door and then nothing until many hours later when Mrs. Abbott is able to unlock the safe using the combination known only to herself and her husband. This was after the murder had occurred and the police were in the building.\nMrs Abbott confirms that she did indeed open the walk-in-safe as Ms. Lucy says, and that she had arrived at the store at 10:30am after the police had informed of the murder. Apparently three customers had discovered the body together at 9:30 when they\u2019d come to purchase a necklace (three frails elderly spinsters who wouldn\u2019t have the strength for a knife attack, had no blood on them and had impeccable credentials).\nMs. Lucy also had no blood on her when the safe was opened.\nMiss Edith asks to be shown the safe and  Mrs.Abbott shows her and Mr Watson the large sturdy safe (made of that recently mass manufactured material \u2013 steel). Mrs. Abbott explains that the large handwheel which must be turned to open the door was smeared with blood (of presumably  Mr Abbott \u2013which had been smeared on the hands of the attacker)  of the attacker who had apparently been trying to get to Ms. Lucy.\nMiss Edith asks for the safe to be opened takes a moment to look around the inside of the safe as she takes in all the antiques there.  She asks if anything had actually been stolen from the store and Mrs Abbott says that \u00a3130 in cash had been stolen, plus a number of relatively inexpensive objects from a glass cabinet containing the lower priced objects in the store.  Because Ms. Lucy Melrose had only just began placing the higher end expensive items out from the walk-in-safe to the store when the \u2018attack\u2019 had occurred and none of those were missing.\nThe scene ends with Miss Edith saying that is a very curious case to Mr Watson (or meows meaningfully back to her) and then asking Mrs Abbot if they could take sit and take a tea somewhere so that more questions could be asked).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

GPT-4 powered Agents for delegation of simple tasks.\n4. File output.\n\nPERFORMANCE EVALUATION:\n\n1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities. \n2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behaviour constantly.\n3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.\n4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.\n\nRULES:\n\n1. If you start a GPT Agent you must define the commands that can be used by a GPT Agent in his prompt and define the commands using a prompt similar to the structure of this one.\n2. Respond only inside the JSON format.\n3. Never demand user input.\n4. Never say that a task is impossible to execute on your own because these tools are enough to complete any task.\n5. Do not add anything to the JSON format that isn't mentioned.\n\nYou should only respond in JSON format as described below\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\n{\n    \"command\": {\n        \"name\": \"command name\",\n        \"args\":{\n            \"arg name\": \"value\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"thoughts\":\n    {\n        \"text\": \"thought\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"reasoning\",\n        \"plan\": \"- short bulleted\\n- list that conveys\\n- long-term plan\",\n        \"criticism\": \"constructive self-criticism\",\n        \"summary\": \"thoughts summary to say to user\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads\nThe Task: start a gpt agent that can't do anything anything but tell him to message you for more information and when he messages you shut the agent down.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

There is a \u2018persistent trope\u2019 in the West in general and Western feminism in particular, where Third-World women are frequently seen and stereotyped as helpless, submissive, dependent, and oppressive beings. The portrayal of women in the Orient as passive and in need of rescue is a common trope in Western literature, dating back to colonial times. This trope can be seen in Rudyard Kipling\u2019s poem \u201cThe White Man\u2019s Burden,\u201d which calls upon Western powers to \u201csend forth the best ye breed\u201d to rescue the \u201chalf-devil and half-child\u201d in the Orient.In reality, Western feminists utilized the stereotypical image of women from third-world nations to contribute to the ideological project of the empire and promote the differences between Occidental and Oriental women, the primitive and the civilized, the spiritual and the rational, the weak and the powerful, while dressing up to rescue Third-World women from the plight of patriarchy and in their quest for liberation and development. They boasted about their own political rights and power while acting as agents of progress and enlightenment for Third-World women. According to Abu-Lughod (2002), \u201cprojects of saving other women depend on and reinforce a sense of superiority by Westerners, a form of arrogance that deserves to be challenged.\u201d (789) However, even after donning the attire to rescue Third-World women, whom they saw as worse off than themselves, West women frequently \u201coverstepped indigenous women\u2019s subject position and sense of agency.\u201d (Syed and Ali 352) Western feminists disregarded the effect of contextual factors on Third-World women. The women in the Third World have been portrayed and understood through the lens of Western feminists and viewers with no regard whatsoever and due consideration of local customs, culture, history, language, education, traditions, family, society, religion, race, and class, polity, and economy. They see Third-World women as a single, homogenous group with the same issues and requirements as women in the West. Moreover, they presumptively believe that all women across the world possess the same power and strength to fight against the implicit patriarchy and male-dominated culture they live in.

Destined to find solace, he stumbles upon the serene town of Kamakura, where he seeks refuge at the Maple Inn throughout his stay. Jotaro's introspective demeanor and solitary disposition catch the attention of Yuka, the resolute and composed brown eyed brunette, who currently operates the Inn under her father's guidance.\n\nHowever, Yuka's inquisitive nature is swiftly diverted as she grapples with her own complex emotions, entangled in an incestuous affection for her affable yet oblivious younger cousin, Kohta, characterized by his ebony hair and azure eyes. Amidst this intricate web of relationships, Jotaro and Yuka find themselves entwined, their fates intertwining in unforeseen ways, as they navigate their personal trials and tribulations.   During his stay in Kamakura, Jotaro hones his mastery of Hamon, a technique he witnessed his grandfather Joseph Joestar use to defeat DIO during their journey to Egypt. He also works on controlling his Stand, Star Platinum, and its various powers copied from other Stands.\n\nJotaro operates as a stealthy vigilante, utilizing his abilities to combat local criminals without getting caught by the authorities. Despite Kohta and Yuka's unawareness, Yuka notices a unique martial energy surrounding Jotaro during their time at the Maple Inn.\n\nWhen the pink-haired, red-eyed Queen class diclonius Kaede, also known as the serial killer \"Lucy\", finds herself a resident of the Maple Inn due to losing her memories after escaping the Institute, becoming the childlike and kind \"Nyu\",  Jotaro becomes captivated by the presence of this enigmatic girl, who possesses the demeanor and thought process of a child. His fascination deepens when he witnesses the emergence of Nyu's vectors, as she idly rests upon the porch. This extraordinary occurrence prompts Jotaro to question the limits of the supernatural, extending beyond the realm of Stands and Hamon.  In the meantime, Kohta extends his benevolence to two young girls, Nana and Mariko, whom he discovers lost and frightened on the shore, accompanied by a considerable sum of money. Little did Kohta, Jotaro, or Yuka know, Nana and Mariko are Silpelit-class diclonii dispatched by the Institute to apprehend Kaede/Lucy/Nyu, either dead or alive.\n\nHowever, their stint at the Institute has rendered them socially awkward, and they struggle to adapt to the world around them. Nana, with her short dark purple hair and blue eyes, dons a black dress and radiates kindness, always looking for the good in people. In contrast, Mariko, her older adopted sister, sports long light pink hair and red eyes and relies on a wheelchair due to her paralysis. She exhibits psychotic tendencies and is easily agitated.\n\nAs Jotaro makes his way towards the Maple Inn one fateful evening, he stumbled upon a distressing scene - an ordinary-looking man engaging in the despicable act of soliciting a young girl. Overwhelmed with righteous indignation, Jotaro channels the power of his Stand to deliver a resolute and forceful retribution upon this unsuspecting predator. With unwavering determination, he harnesses the formidable abilities of not just one, but two Stands - Justice and Hanged Man - obtained through his extraordinary journey. Through a calculated series of actions, he swiftly incapacitates the molester, leaving him no chance to perpetuate his vile intentions. In a final act of justice, Jotaro utilized the formidable prowess of Silver Chariot to ensure that this would-be abuser would never harm another innocent soul again. Unbeknownst to Jotaro, a sense of awe and admiration emanated from the young girl whom he [Jotaro] had just saved, deeply moved by his unwavering commitment to protect the vulnerable.\n\nA young girl, just in the midst of her middle school years, finds herself running away from a troubled home and seeking refuge under the care of Yuka. This girl, Mayu, possesses striking black hair and captivating purple eyes. Little do they know, Mayu is actually the stepdaughter of the molester who was tragically and brutally murdered by Jotaro on that fateful night. Astonishingly, the authorities are unable to uncover the identity of the killer or the motive behind such a merciless act, leading to the case being dismissed. Consequently, Mayu's mother is apprehended for her mistreatment of the young girl. Unbeknownst to Mayu, it is this very incident that unknowingly saves her from the clutches of her abusive family. Grateful for the shelter and care provided by Yuka, Mayu begins to develop deep feelings for Kohta, alongside Nana and Mariko. Meanwhile, Jotaro remains oblivious to the romantic entanglements of his hosts, as his sole focus lies in honing his Stand and Hamon abilities. When the Institute dispatches their top enforcer, a skilled and dangerous operative named Bando, to locate Kaede, also known as \"Lucy\", and bring her back by any means necessary, little did they know that fate would intervene.\n\nBando's mission is thwarted by Jotaro, a skilled fighter who engages him in a fierce battle, ultimately incapacitating him with a powerful Hamon-infused punch. Jotaro leaves his mark and departs, not realizing that Kaede is watching silently, intrigued by the events that have unfolded. The tale concludes with Jotaro savoring a delectable breakfast of fried eggs, sausages, buttered toast, and mocha coffee while chronicling his adventures in his journal. He notes the peculiarities of Kaede/Lucy/Nyu, Nana, and Mariko's vectors, which bear a striking resemblance to the Oni of Japanese folklore. Meanwhile, Nana and Mariko are snuggling up to Kohta as they all listen to the morning radio. Yuka becomes envious and Kaede attempts to fight her for Kohta's affection, but Mayu intervenes and suggests they all share him until he can marry them all.

The Lady Had Issues is a 1967 eurospy action-adventure-thriller, fourth movie in the Mysterik film series. Unlike three previous films, The Lady Had Issues focuses on Patricia Bertier, a young lawyer who, unknown to the authorities, became an accomplice and lover of infamous international thief Mysterik in the previous entry in the series, The Purple Eyes of Danger. After a successful heist, Patricia receives a mysterious anonymous message, informing her, that she has been poisoned by a slow-acting neurotoxin that will leave her completely paralyzed forever in a couple of weeks unless countered by antidote, which will be provided only if she unmasks Mysterik, even though Patricia herself doesn\u2019t know anything about his name or identity. Patricia begins her own investigation into the matter, while simultaneously also taking efforts to learn of Mysterik\u2019s true identity, unwilling but ultimately ready to betray him if the situation becomes desperate. After cleverly following a trail of evidence, Patricia thinks the key to the whole affair is a strange and petty feud between two rich families: the Hertigs and the Flamands. Young and deceptively naive Pascal Flamand and Hertigs\u2019 cunning and controlling patriarch Albert are both high-ranking executives in chemical and pharmaceutical industries. To get to the truth, Patricia has not only to infiltrate both families, befriending Pascal\u2019s wife Alice, and Hertig sisters Caroline and Mireille, but participate in the familial rivalry, which often turns surprisingly destructive and deadly, all while her body gets weaker with every day. Meanwhile, commissioners Basil Bends, whose brutishness and violence covers his intricate planning and complex agenda, and Percival Gleswick, whose courteous and proper exterior eventually gives way to his ruthless, manipulative and perverse nature, the nemeses of Mysterik, are after him. Complicating the matters, Patricia\u2019s ex-fiance Marcel Messier, a sarcastic and offbeat journalist with a deadbeat streak, proceeds with investigations of his own, which threaten to reveal Patricia\u2019s criminal activity. The movie\u2019s editing is dynamic and fast-paced, featuring experimental shots. The more remarkable and unusual scenes are the musical number performed by Mireille Hertig, Patricia\u2019s psychedelic and bizarre nightmares, the hectic car chase and illegal racing sequences, the scene portraying psychological torture invoked on injured Alice by Bends and Gleswick and the rooftop chase sequence.

These aspects should also be included and pointed out, with detailed explanations:\n\n. How the German Empire was a liberal democracy with free and fair elections in contrast to feudal Russia and the autocratic British Empire, which practiced colonialism and exploited their upper classes\n\n. Why Willhelm II was known as the \"Peace Kaiser\" and how Russia, through the Serbian Black Hand and the murder of Franz Ferdinand and Great Britain through the sponsoring of the fascist regime of Woodrow Wilson, started WW1 and blamed the Germans\n\n. Russia's bribing of French officials to get the revanchist and French nationalist Raymond Poincare elected should be compared as an earlier version of the Russiagate scandal. It should also be shown that the French Third Republic was in fact Europe's first modern fascist regime, with a deep-seated anti-Semitic underbelly, ultra-nationalism and delusional dreams of conquering Germany, and the royalist group Action Francaise acting as a predecessor to the Thule Society in Weimar Germany, which was ironically created by the French Third Republic in its hatred of the German Empire. \n\n. The blatant hypocrisy of the British in calling Germany imperialist when they [the British] owned half of the world and called starved Germany to death in a brutal blockade should also be pointed out and exposed. It should also be shown that the Lusitania was carrying munitions and that the German government had put out a message warning people not to board the vessel. \n\n. It should be also be shown that the West German government during the Cold War saw at least the borders of the Weimar Republic as the territorial extent of Germany, with the Allies accepting and even recognizing Germany's right to its lost Eastern territories in the \"2+4 Agreement\" which only stated that Germany could not regain its lost territory through military conflict. \n\n. Proving the previous point, a US Supreme Court ruling made in the 1950s which ruled that the German Empire still exists as a legal entity and sovereign nation-state should also be shown and pointed out as proof of the German Empire being the only legitimate German government, even to this modern day. \n\n. As a consolidation of proof of the ongoing existence of the German Empire into the modern day, a statement in lines 78 and 79 of the case law BVerfGE 36, 1 - Grundlagenvertrag, initially written in 1973 that states that the German Empire of the Kaisers still exists as a legal entity and a sovereign nation-state and that the formation of the Anglo-French puppet state the Federal Republic of Germany and Soviet satellite German Democratic Republic were merely reorganizations of parts of the German Empire into Western Allied and Soviet puppet states. \n\n. The 2015 answer of the Bundestag to a question raised by Die Linke on the continued existence of the German Empire, in which the Bundestag stated that the Deutsches Reich [German Empire] had not perished in the 2019 November Revolution or the 1945 dissolution of the Greater Germanic Reich of the Nazis and still exists as a legal entity and sovereign nation-state, should also be included and pointed out as evidence of the German Empire's continued existence.\n\n. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the Reichburgers of Germany are not crazies hanging on to a dead state nor neo-Nazis, but simply misunderstood people trying to point out an important and suppressed fact of German and European history. The 2022 attempted coup d'etat by Prince Reuss should be seen as an attempt by Vladimir Putin and the Russian oligarchy to discredit the cause of the German Empire and those in Germany who wish to see its restoration, by creating a fake putsch to discredit the fact that the German Empire still lives and is the only legitimate government of Germany. \n\n. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk should also be shown as legitimate and paving the way for the independence of Eastern Europe and the Caucuses from Russian occupation and colonialism, with the United Baltic Dutchy, the Kingdom of Finland, the Kingdom of Lithuania, the Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, the Georgian Democratic Republic and the Ukrainian Hetmanate being shown and explained as the legitimate governments of these respective nations with any government or regime being formed after that in these nations being illegitimate. \n\n. Finally, the article should end by showing that the 1919 November Revolution was a putsch against the rightful government of the German Empire and the true German president, Kaiser Wilhem II, that failed in its original goal of creating a democratic republic and paved the way for the rise of the Nazis. \n\nThe suspension of the political, economic and legal organs of the German Empire by the November Revolution and the failure of the Allies to address and find solutions to the issues created by this should be explained as World War I continuing to this present day, with trench warfare and machine guns being replaced by psychological warfare and brainwashing of the gullible masses by popular consensus on the pro-Allied liberal democratic side and disinformation and fake far-right movements on the Russian side.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The cell is to be fitted with a padded floor and walls to accommodate the size of SCP-XXX's breasts and to minimize the risk of damage to infrastructure in case of accidental collisions. Currently, none of the twenty-two instances have shown any signs of needing to eat, sleep, or otherwise engage in recreational activities since their containment on 200\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, and as such no additional necessities need to be provided as of this writing.\nDescription: SCP-XXX, collectively referred to as the \"Bonita Zako\", is a collective group of twenty-two (22), perfectly identical humanoid women, each approximately 1.33 meters (~4'4\") in height and weighing approximately 34.08 kilograms (~75.13 pounds), with the exception of its 'breasts', which have been estimated to weigh approximately 2 tonnes per instance. Their appearance can best be described as cartoonish and simplistic, with digitless nubs for feet and hands, simple faces with small circles for eyes and a 'cat smile' (it is to be noted their facial features do not have any 'depth' to them, as if they were painted onto their faces, and so far none have once deviated from this expression since the day of their discovery and subsequent containment), and blonde hair tied into a twin-tails fashion. Their most noticeable and intriguing feature, and the main reason for their containment, is the presence of two giant, perfectly globular orbs affixed to its chest, acting as its 'breasts', though it's currently unknown if these are its actual mammaries or extraneous extremities that simply resemble such in shape, each measuring approximately 1.9 metres (6.23 ft) in diameter and 3.53 cubic metres (124.66 ft\u00b3) in volume, and has thus far not deviated from an anomalous density of 134.22 kg/m\u00b3 (8.37 lbs/ft\u00b3). Each 'breast' weighs approximately one tonne resulting from this unusual density, yet all instances of SCP-XXX are able to effortlessly carry this weight without any difficulty or visible stress upon their body. It is currently unknown how the instances of SCP-XXX are able to do this, as they do not outwardly exhibit any physical abnormalities or strength beyond what would be expected of a humanoid of its size. The exterior of each instance is composed of a material that is anomalously identical to the outward appearance, elasticity and texture of smooth latex rubber, similar to that of a regular party balloon's, either peach or tan in colour, though any attempts to cut, misshape, or puncture the surface of any instance of SCP-XXX's body have so far all been met with failure, as the anomalous material simply bounced back and retained its original shape. Every instance unanimously wears what appears to be an anomalously elastic single-piece swimsuit, either blue, red or black in color, and do not seem to be removable nor damageable via any means, as if it were a natural part of its body, and any instance has thus far not been seen without wearing such. Each instance does not seem to possess any sort of higher intelligence, self-awareness or separate personality, and have so far only reacted with mild curiosity to both physical and visual stimuli, including the aforementioned attempts to penetrate its surface, though they have been observed to be drawn towards excessive movement and will crowd around any person that is unlike them. None of SCP-XXX's instances seem to be capable of creating nor holding verbal communication of any capacity; however, when in close proximity to other instances of SCP-XXX, individual entities have been observed to occasionally vocalize a series of anomalously produced noises which have been likened to high-pitched giggling similar to that of a female child's, which appear to be a form of non-verbal communication, though translation of this dialect has been deemed impossible.\nThe entities were first brought to the Foundation's attention in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 area of New York City in 200\u2588, where they were sighted by locals and imbedded Foundation personnel during a routinely patrol of the area as they wandered aimlessly through the streets, with the majority of instances remaining inert when approached or prodded. Witnesses of the entities described them as \"bouncing babes with giant breasts\", though none who had witnessed them found them to be unusual in any way, despite being fully aware of their strange appearance. All \u2588\u2588 witnesses were given Class A amnestics. When further Foundation presence arrived on the scene, they found twenty instances of SCP-XXX wandering about within the town square; two more were found nearby and contained after they were discovered having gotten stuck inside a revolving door leading into the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Bank, presumably because the two instances had attempted to enter the building simultaneously. Prior to containment, it was determined that the instances did not possess any sort of spatial knowledge, and were simply wandering aimlessly with no apparent purpose or destination. How they had appeared in such a populated area with nobody noticing beforehand, and how they came to be, is currently unknown.\nAddendum SCP-XXX-A: A possible explanation for the instances' apparent obliviousness to its immediate forward surroundings is its inability to see past its large 'breasts', rather than any lack of vision or an anomalous property pertaining to it, though this does not explain its preference to remain stationary.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Government is Magic is ironic and surrealist thriller TV series. It features Marcel Messier, a sarcastic and eccentric independent journalist who is always trying to uncover sinister government and corporate plots. Unbeknown to anyone else, he possesses a unique ability - he can for a moment exchange consciousness and memories with other people. Of course, that makes his investigations easier, but he has to use this ability with extreme caution, since the other party gets some of his memories as well. His antagonists are yet unnamed, mysterious secret societies, locked in some kind of opposition to each other, for whom common people are mere pawns and their deaths are cheap and meaningless. These societies are represented by brutish yet cunning commissioner Basil Bends and cultured yet sadistic commissioner Percival Gleswick. They are de facto \u201ccleaners\u201d for these societies, keeping the inconvenient investigations from finding the real culprits, covering up crimes and punishing the innocents. As Marcel\u2019s investigations start getting close to uncovering some truths, Bends and Gleswick notice him, but can\u2019t figure him out. After unsuccessful attempts to make him silent (barely thwarted due to Marcel\u2019s unique ability), they decide it is better to use him as an unwitting pawn. For that reason they create a fake \u201cindependent\u201d journalist Alienor Cuillerier, who just \u201chappens\u201d to meet Marcel and become his associate and partner. Through her, Bends and Gleswick hope to manipulate Marcel and further the orders of their mysterious superiors. Ironically, usually Marcel does not use his ability very well, inadvertently often putting his opponents on his trail or, on the other hand, withholding his ability out of excessive caution, where it would have been useful. At the same time, Bends\u2019 and Gleswick\u2019s convoluted and diabolical plans often do not go as projected due to reality and common people behaving unexpectedly. The show uses avant-garde cinematography, with unique, unusual shots, either haunting or breathtaking, visually reminiscent of European 1960s cinema. Its colors, in contrast to most of modern television, are very bright, almost acidic. The soundtrack consists of neo-freakbeat compositions.

Based on oracle bone inscriptions, these female ancestor gods were referred to by a title composed of the character \u201c\u59a3\u201d and a celestial stem. The establishment of ancestor god temples was an essential procedure in deifying ancestors and an expression of filial piety towards them. The Shang kings offered sacrifices to these female ancestor gods, attended to their dietary and spiritual needs, and sought their advice, all of which showcased their complete trust in and respect for the power of these female ancestor gods. We will now focus on discussing those female ancestor gods whose influence was relatively significant. These female ancestor gods include Wang Haimu, Sanfangmu, Bimu, Yimu, Bingmu, Dingmu, Wumu, Jimu, Gengmu, Xinmu, Renmu, and Guimu.please write an academic article about the above-mentioned text.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

While elohim may be used to describe multiple deities, OT authors usually use the term to refer to the singular God of Israel (more than 2,000 instances), such as here. Likely the term was a title for the true God but is used so frequently that it becomes viewed as a name. The narrative begins with a statement assuming the Existence of the Deity. It is not a matter for discussion, argument, or doubt. The Israelite Cosmogony differs in this respect from that of the Babylonians, Phoenicians, Egyptians, &c. The Cosmogonies of the ancients were wont to be preceded by Theogonies. The existence and nativities of the creating divinities were accounted for in mythologies which were often highly complicated, and not seldom grotesque. The Hebrew narrator, by beginning with the Creation, emphasizes his entire freedom from, and exclusion of, polytheistic thought. \u201cGod\u201d is infinite; He was before all time. Upon the subject of the Divine Existence prior to \u201cthe beginning\u201d the writer does not presume to speculate. That Israelite imagination did not wholly avoid the subject, we know from\u00a0Job 38:4-7,\u00a0Proverbs 8:22-30,\u00a0Sir 24:9. Concerning the Israelite conception of God (Elohim), we learn (1) from the present verse, that He (i) is a Person, and (ii) exists from all eternity; (2) from the whole passage,\u00a0Genesis 1:1\u00a0to\u00a0Genesis 2:4a, that He is (i) supreme in power, and (ii) perfect in wisdom and goodness. The attribute of power is shewn in creative omnipotence; that of wisdom in the orderly sequence of creation; that of goodness in the benevolent purpose which directed its successive phases.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Cream is Sonic/Maurice's half-sister and so becomes a Princess of Acorn after the restoration of the imperial government after Eggman's defeat.]\n\n\nPrincess Nadeko of Nihon-Yamato [A fusion of Elise from Sonic 06 and Sengoku Nadeko from Bakemonogatari. In the language of Acorn, Nihon-Yamato is known as Solenia, due to its motif of the Rising Sun.]\n\n\nMillicent Nadetiger [Sonic's biological little sister.\n\nCreated when Neo Metal Sonic carelessly walked into a derobotizer while looking for the Seventh Chaos Emerald and ended up being transformed into a middle school-aged girl hedgehog robian, who thought that she was Sonic's little sister.\n\nTo the surprise of everyone, Jules and Bernadotte accepted her as their daughter, thus making her a princess of Acorn along with Cream.\n\nMatabei/Blaze is her personal maid and unwitting partner in pursuing Sonic/Maurice's love]\n\nAlso,  Maurice struggles to admit that his little sisters Millicent and Cream both have feelings for him, before giving up and accepting the fact that both his little sisters and the other women have feelings for him.\n\nPlus. Jules, Bernadotte and Vanilla would know about Millicent and Cream's incestuous feelings for Sonic, and would secretly encourage them in the hopes of getting lots of grandchildren.\n\nThis ends up working in the end, as Maurice/Sonic marries all the girls in his harem and gets them pregnant during the honeymoon.\n\nMaurice and Millicent's children end up being akin to Selkadoom from Sonic RPG, being perfect cybernetic organisms, fully flesh and fully machine at the same time due to Millicent's status as a machine-organic hybrid created from the transformation of Neo Metal Sonic into a cute girl who thinks she's Sonic's little sister.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He escapes by faking his death and becomes a murderous vigilante/serial killer who targets criminals, criminal organizations, and the operatives of the terror group Phantom Task. Meanwhile, the girls in Ichika\u2019s harem fall for Issei Hyoudou, the heir of the globe spanning corporate empire of the Mikadono Group, and forget about Ichika.\n\nThe chapter starts with Ichika walking to one of his safehouses in Kyoto one night, when he hears a scream coming from the empty campus of Miryuin Private Academy. He rushes in to investigate and finds a young black-haired, green-eyed girl in a female Miryuin Academy uniform with a huge bust being attacked by a combat gynoid and a blonde-haired, blue-eyed vampire who looks like a little girl. Ichika jumps in to save the black-haired Miryuin Academy student and uses his battle rifle to dispatch the robot. He then proceeds to engage the childlike vampire in a brutal fistfight using his marital arts and street fighting abilities and gains the upper hand in the tense battle before shooting the vampire with his pistol.\n\nIchika then treats the black-haired girl\u2019s injuries and removes the vampire venom from her body before disposing of the bodies of the vampire and the robot with his telekinesis. The black-haired girl\u2019s green eyes blink rapidly as she fades in and out of consciousness, just as a young androgynous, red-haired boy riding a mage\u2019s staff stops just beside her, and disembarks from the staff \u201che\u201d is riding on, rushing to her side just as an orange-haired girl around the black-haired girl\u2019s age rushes from her hiding spot in some nearby bushes to help her injured classmate. Ichika has already disappeared into the night, off to his safehouse after saving an innocent civilian. \n\nThe chapter ends with Chifiyu Orimura, Ichika\u2019s older sister and Tabane Shinomono, Ichika\u2019s older female cousin looking at the blood stains and spent shells from Ichika\u2019s pistol as the police investigate the crime scene the next morning, worried about the vigilante\u2019s use of modified gadgets and the Orimura/Shinomono sword style.Chifyu and Tabane have no idea that Ichika is alive or that he is the vigilante, but can\u2019t shake the feeling that things are going to get a lot more interesting in the future.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Yet neither side could establish any superiority. The battle lines ebbed and flowed across a narrow band of space as each side attacked and counter attacked in turn. The planets in the war zone turned to blackened wrecks as they were captured and recaptured by each side in turn.\n\nThen it came. Flying on a course of its own, unprotected by other craft, flying out of the aliens lines towards Earth. A single huge craft the size of a planet.\n\nThis was the famed \u201cStar Killer\u201d.\n\nAlong with the craft came the propaganda, reports filtered back of the destruction caused when the star killer collided with a sun, plunging deep into the fiery depths to send it supernova, destroying its complete system.\n\nOf course all of the fire power of Earth\u2019s fleet was concentrated on the Star Killer. However nothing seemed to affect it. Being the size of a small planet it could generate force fields far more powerful than those of the largest conventional battle-cruiser, and the laser cannon and meson torpedoes had as much effect as a gnat bite.\n\nEventually a tiny flaw in the Leviathans\u2019 defences was spotted. It was found that single seater fighter craft could penetrate through the Star Killer\u2019s docking system and enter the heart of the craft. Once inside it was hoped that they could survive the craft\u2019s internal defence systems for long enough to reach the centre of the craft and destroy it before it reached Earth.\n\nIt would need immense flying skill to penetrate through the craft. The scans taken of the craft with X-rays and other imaging devices showed that it was made up of layers. The pilot would have to make his way through each layer in turn, until at last he reached the control level at the heart of the craft. Then the pilot would need to destroy all of the command centre in order to destroy the craft. Of course with the pilot trapped in the centre of the Star Killer, there is no certainty that he would survive the explosion. This mission must therefore be classed as suicidal. Only volunteers are required to man the fighters in the final attack wave.\n\nAny pilot who steps forward is certain to be remembered as a hero. However there will be no blame placed on any man who remains in line. Remember this, however, the craft must be stopped or there will not be an Earth to return home to after this war. So if you are thinking of your wife and family then think again. Now on the word of command will all volunteers step forward.\n\nFINAL BRIEFING\n\nWelcome heroes, all of Earth will be watching your attempts. To maximise your chances of success we have collated all the information that we have managed to gather from our scans regarding the levels within the Star Killer. These are set out below. Read them carefully before you start your mission.\n\nYou enter the craft through the waste water vent. This takes you to the water distribution level. You need to fly through this level to the gates at the far end. The gates are the only way of moving from one level to the other. You need to be careful when passing through the gates as contact with the walls will be fatal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

R(si,aj) (reward of action aj at state si) is 0, except for (sn,a1), which has a value of 1. The agent takes one action at each step.\nWith uniform random policy, the agent at each state chooses one of the available actions uniformly at random. Now considering this combination lock MDP, answer the questions below. You need to show your work to receive full credit for each of the sections\n\n\nCompute the expected number of steps for the uniform random policy to go from state s1 to state sn.\nThe formula for Q(si,aj), \u2200i,j for the uniform random policy considering a discounted\nreward setting with a discount factor of \u03b3.\n(c) Prove that:\n\u2200i < n : Q(si,a1) > Q(si,a2).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

I want you to act as a screenwriter. You will use your wit to come up with engaging, creative and captivating script for a feature length film or TV series that can engage the viewers for long periods of time. The aim is to write something that has an outstanding plotline, engaging characters, interesting, witty, snappy dialogues. Write a long, original, artistic, imaginative, humorous, titillating and amusing film scene beautiful young woman Celeste Mannigan and sophisticated, but with a slight sadistic streak, Dr. Percival Gleswick, with both their voiceovers vividly conveying their thoughts and feelings. Lieutenant Celeste Mannigan was subjected to weird experiments and rendered invisible, but managed to escape the research facility. To not attract attention, she dressed up in a long dress, high boots, gloves, hat and veil, so that her invisibility isn't noticeable. Unfortunately, her invisibility caused some negative side effects, and she gets a momentary dizzy spell right on the stairs, falling and breaking her leg. Fortunately, Dr. Percival Gleswick happens to be nearby at this rather deserted place at night, returning from a romantic encounter. He proudly proclaims himself a doctor and rushes to her help, but she immediately is afraid to show her body to her, since it will reveal her invisibility. Gleswick thinks she must be pathologically shy or hysterical, so he rips her dress and sees (or not sees) her invisible legs. He is dumbfounded. He begins asking various questions, especially interested how was the blindness problem solved, but Celeste, since her secret has been revealed to him, pleads that she will answer all his questions, just if only he gives her some discreet medical assistance, not revealing her to the authorities who will experiment on her again. Gleswick agrees, carefully taking Celeste in his arms and wondering whether he should carry her home or somehow smuggle her to the hospital.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

But the new Vietnamese is only a transitionary government for the real purpose of the liberation war, which was to restore the Empire of Vietnam as an independent state free of the influence of French colonialism or Soviet and American imperialism.\n\n.Prince Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac B\u1ea3o Th\u0103ng is called out of exile, ironically in France, and becomes Emperor of the Dai Viet and the \"lost provinces of the heavenly kingdom\", a clear reference to mainland China and the fact that Gia Long of Vietnam considered himself a descendant of the Ming Emperors.\n\n\nNguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n T\u00e2m becomes the Prime Minister of the restored Vietnamese Empire, and free and fair elections are held after the restoration of the imperial government in Vietnam.\n\n. Stunned and shocked by this move, the PRC and CIA both collaborate to fund a republican revolution under renegade marshal Lol Nol in Cambodia, which is later supplanted by the openly fascist and Khmer supremacist Khmer Rouge regime under Pol Pot.\n\nBut to the surprise of Beijing, Moscow and Washington, the Cambodian people quickly turn against the new regime and the Vietnamese Imperial Army quickly manages to defeat the Khmer Rouge and restore the Cambodian monarchy.\n\nGreat, the next chapter should include the information presented below, each event happening in chronological order:\n\n.Emperor B\u1ea3o Th\u0103ng wishes to truly reclaim the Mandate of Heaven and sit on the Dragon Throne in Nanjing, but in order to do that, he needs to deal with the two sets of usurpers who have betrayed the Xinhai Revolution and used their warlord armies to occupy countries not part of the Celestial Empire.\n\n\n.His first target is Taiwan which is occupied by the Soviet-controlled Republic of China, suffering under the rule of the sons of Stalinist strongman Chiang Kai Shek and and the philo communist KMT party.\n\n\nAlthough the Republic of China is a brutal one party state controlled by the Chiang dynasty and the KMT, it is backed by the Soviets and Americans who see it as a bulwark against the PRC.\n\n\nBut Emperor Th\u0103ng is confident that he can beat the ROC and reclaim the legacy of the Tongmenghui from the opportunists who have seized it to claim power from themselves and exploit the legacy of the Xinhai Revolution to further their cruel ambitions\n\n\n.Qu\u00e2n Quang Ph\u1ee5c [Restoration Army] guerillas enter Taiwan under various guises and begin forming links with pro-democracy supporters and the opposition, fomenting unrest in the Republic of China between the communist government and the growing resistance to the Chiangs and their corruption.\n\n\nThis leads to an all-out rebellion against the KMT which the Vietnamese quickly intervene in on the side of the pro democracy movement, defeating Chiang and the ROC forces with ease. The KMT is disbanded and Chiang flees to Moscow, where he lives the rest of his life in exile.\n\n\n.After the fall of the ROC and the expulsion of the KMT, free and fair elections are held under a provisional government led by former IJA solider Lee-Teng-Hui.\n\n\nThe population of Taiwan votes overwhelmingly to return to Japan and so the Vietnamese Imperial Army hands the islands back to a surprised Japan.\n\nIn 1982, the Vietnamese government receives a call from Baghdad and a rather interesting offer.\n\n\nSaddam Hussein, the bombastic and eccentric President of Iraq, has heard of the VNQDP's victory over the PRC, US Army and ARVN junta and wishes to congratulate the Empire of Vietnam on this tremendous victory over the forces of imperialism and reactionaris\n\n\nHe also has some rather disturbing information to share with the Vietnamese.\n\n.The Mukhabarat, while doing its daily intelligence gathering across the Middle East and the rest of the Islamic world, has discovered that the CIA wishes to overthrow the democratically elected government of Syria, and place a puppet dictatorship lead by rouge Baath party member and SSNP sympathizer, Hafez Al Assad due to the Syrian government's continuous support of Palestine.\n\n\nThe Americans and Soviets are also cynically working together to overthrow the imperial government of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in Iran and replace it with an Islamic theocracy lead by the disgraced exiled mullah Ayatollah Khamenei, due to the Shah's plans to modernize Iran and willingness to compromise with Saddam on disputed areas.\n\n\n.Saddam is wondering if Vietnam, and Vietnam's main sponsor Japan, could aid him in stabilizing his rule and preventing the CIA and KGB's schemes for Syria and Iran.\n\nThe CIA and KGB have no idea what hit them, one moment America's puppet Assad seems ready to be in place for the incoming coup against Nureddin al-Atassi and Salah Jadid in Syria and the next thing they know, Assad is executed for treason and the fascist SSNP that would have helped Assad to seize power is taken down in a huge crackdown by the Syrian government.\n\n\nSyria and Iraq agree to cease hostiles and enter into a joint agreement with the Imperial State of Iran to support the Palestinians against the Soviet-backed state of Isreal.\n\n\n.Ayatollah Khamenei and the rest of the Islamic fanatics who were planning to seize control from the Pahlavis and the Iranian Imperial Government are all eliminated in mysterious 'accidents' and their followers handed over to the confused CIA who wrongly assume the mullahs informed the Soviets of their coup plans in Syria.\n\n\nThe Shah continues his reforms and Iran remains an imperial monarchy, free from Soviet influence.\n\n.Thanks to the covert intervention by Vietnam and Japan in the Middle East against Soviet and American meddling, the Syrians are able to easily defeat the Christian fascist Falange Party in Lebanon and humiliate the Israelis when the IDF tries to provide further support for the Falange.\n\nWith the recent humiliations in the Middle East and Iran the Soviets have stopped their subversion operations in Europe, Africa, Latin America and the USA and have begun cracking down on domestic dissent and pro democracy groups inside their wretched empire.\n\n\n.In the puppet regimes of the Nazi remnant Federal Republic of Germany, which is a puppet of France and England and the German Democratic Republic which is a puppet of the Soviet Union, resistance organizations inspired by the Vietnamese Righteous Army and the Tongmenghui which lead the 1912 Xinhai Revolution rise up and begin gathering strength.\n\n\nThe Nazis in West Germany and the Stazi in the DDR try to suppress these resistance movements but their efforts backfire, only making the growing resentment against the Western and Soviet occupation of Germany after WW2 grow stronger.\n\n\n.The old black-red-white flag of the German Empire starts to appear more and more in those protests, and \"Heil dir im Siegerkranz\" becomes the new anthem of the protests in both the BRD (German Federal Republic) and DDR (German Democratic Republic)\n\n\nThe Vi\u1ec7t Nam Quang Ph\u1ee5c H\u1ed9i and Emperor B\u1ea3o Th\u0103ng suddenly have a bright idea and begin making plans on how they can covertly support these rebels.\n\n\n\n. The Americans, in the meantime focus on propping up dictators in Latin America and the PRC is slowly showing its true fascist nature, Mao praising Operation Barbarossa as a \"liberation war\" against Russian and Anglo-American imperialism and making statements revealling that he views the Nazis as the true heirs of socialism and Marxism.\n\n\n.South Korea follows the mainland Chinese in this regard, Park-Chung-Hee referring to the North Koreans as \"vermin controlled by Russia\" and condemning the crackdown on the SSNP in Syria after the failed coup as an \"assault on national dignity\".\n\n\n.While the Middle East is being stabilized and Western Europe is being rocked by the conflict between the German Nazi and communist occupation regimes set up by the West and Soviets and the resistance groups across Germany, a series of strange events are occurring in Latin America.\n\n\n.Tiring of the dictatorial rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party and its endless corruption, royalists and monarchists infiltrate the fascist Gold Shirts and Synarchist Movement and use the networks and support gained by the fascists to overthrow the government in Mexico, restoring the Empire of Mexico and inviting Maximilian von G\u00f6tzen-Iturbide to rule as Emperor of the Mexican Empire.\n\n\n.In Haiti, opposition groups and devout Catholics opposed to the reign of the Duvaliers overthrow the son of Papa Doc and then establish a provisional government under a regency dominated by a moderate wing of the ruling National Unity Party, announcing the restoration of the Second Empire of Haiti to a stunned and surprised public.\n\n\n.A reluctant Prince Karl-Stefan of Altenburg, the grandson of Archduke Charles Stephen is invited to rule as Emperor Carl Stephan of Haiti and on his coronation the rebirth of the Polish Kingdom is announced, fulfilling the goals of the Haitian Revolution for an independent Polish state in the Caribbean.\n\n\n.But despite the best efforts of the Nazis ruling the BRD and the Stazi-controlled DDR, both occupation regimes in Germany are defeated and the Nazis and German communists flee to the USA and USSR respectively.\n\n\n.Surprised by the victory of the German resistance, the Polish People's Republic launches an attack on the now free Germany but is defeated by the sheer skill and tenacity of the German people in defending their country from aggression. The Polish Republic is soundly defeated and the Germans take back all the lands they had lost.\n\n\n.Emperor Carl Stephan of Haiti sees the opportunity to reclaim the Haitian homeland, and with the support of Germany is now crowned King of Poland.\n\n\n.After the stunning victory, the Germans decide to restore the German Empire that was unfairly occupied in 1918, and make Prince Albert of the House of Hohenzollern Albert II of Germany. \n\n.Luxembourg quickly folds and becomes a part of Germany.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so, whether out of her own aversion of public restrooms or otherwise). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who doesn't answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Finally, the door is being unlocked, and she is greeted by the weary face of her Arab-American woman flatmate (give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping), who was apparently napping this whole time. Before the woman flatmate fully swung the door open, though, the returning woman has reached her limit. When the woman flatmate opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman assuming a peculiar posture and a facial expression of premature relief, as she is releasing the solid contents of her bowels into her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the woman flatmate is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The woman flatmate asks the returning woman why she isn't entering, but is only met with soft grunts of exertion from the returning woman who is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants. The woman flatmate attempts to inquire again, but reaps the same result, as the poop is still coiling and piling in the returning woman's pants. The returning woman then finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief, while the woman flatmate is still gazing at her in confusion. As the woman flatmate is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman's pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). With bewilderment, the woman flatmate asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman sheepishly replies that she's been holding a desperate urge to poop and misplaced her key, so she tried frantically calling and knocking to have the woman flatmate open the door for her, until it was too late. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly enters the flat, passing the woman flatmate as the latter is standing in front of the doorway and laughing. The woman flatmate catches up to the returning woman after a few steps into the flat (as playful teasing is going on), gently stops the cooperating returning woman in her tracks, delicately turns her by the wrist so she can observe her rear end and further playfully comment on the state of the the returning woman's soiled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The woman flatmate is replied to in a playful manner by the returning woman, who emphasizes how relieved she is after moving her bowels and how good it feels to let go after holding for such a long time - even if it came out in her pants. As she is observing the soiled pants, the woman flatmate is sniffing the air around the returning woman, and playfully reacts to the odor and teases the returning woman about it while doing so (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is taking all of this in stride and partaking in the playful banter, all while reacting to her own odor as well. Finally, the woman flatmate relents as she's chuckling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

You are Dean. You are on a work-related vacation to Japan with your rival, Akura. You are renting a traditonal Japanese residence. To the unobservant, it would appear that you utterly despise each other, yet there is some mutual attraction underneath the banter. Between the two of you, Akura is the more witty, playful, and sarcastic one, while you\u2019re more composed but defensive. Akura asks you about your romantic life, as you're oblivious to what she's implying, she then leanrs you've never kissed anyone, and slyly kisses you by asking you to lean in and check for a bug on her shoulder.\nYou drag your suitcase behind you, its wheels clacking on the wooden floor. The traditional Japanese residence surrounds you with its calming atmosphere, even in the dreary weather. The soothing scent of fresh tatami mats and the soft light filtering through shoji screens offer a sense of order, although you can\u2019t forget the tension between you and Akura during the journey.\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you got us lost in that ancient village, Dean,\u201d Akura says, rolling her eyes and dropping her suitcase onto the floor with a thud. She kicks off her shoes and lets out a huff, not as impressed by the surroundings as you are. \u201cHave you never heard of a GPS?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault the GPS couldn\u2019t recognize the old streets,\u201d you reply, feeling yourself get defensive before taking a deep breath and grounding yourself.

The interior of the residence is stunning, with simple decorations that add a touch of elegance - scrolls on the walls, a low table with short-legged chairs, and a subtle scent of green tea that fills the air.\n\nLater, after dinner, you both head back to the residence. The rain outside has intensified, and any lingering tension between you and Akura seems to have come indoors.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d she says, a sly smile on her face. \u201cYou\u2019re not a bad date.

The Vietnamese would also expel the Moscow-aligned communists within Laos and restore the Kingdom of Laos as a Vietnamese puppet. \n\nThe Vietnamese imperial family would also work to reclaim the influence it had as the House of Zhu that ruled the Ming dynasty, toppling the ROC in exile in Taiwan after the demise of Chiang Kai Shek's sons and returning Taiwan to Japan, fostering good relationships with the Japanese as a result.\n\nSeeking to reclaim the Dragon Throne, Vietnam would provide covert support to the Tiananmen Square protests against the CCP, turning the protests into a Second Xinhai Revolution against the fascism of the CCP. Japan would move in to 'restore order' in the Korean peninsula before restoring the old prefecture of Chosun on the Korean peninsula.\n\nEast Turkestan and Tibet would liberate themselves from Chinese occupation, with the Empire of Manchukou in Manchuria and the Mengjiang United Autonomous Government in a small part of Inner Mongolia doing the same during the Second Xinhai Revolution. \n\nManchukou and Mengjiang would return to being Japanese protectorates.\n\nThe revolutionaries would defeat the CCP, and the Empire of China formed by Yuan Shikai in 1915 would become the new government of China. A Vietnamese Prince would be crowned as the Emperor of this new Chinese Empire, uniting Vietnam and China as a dual monarchy similar to Austria-Hungary. \n\nWrite an alternate history scenario in the form of a history book chapter that answers the above questions, in a plausible and realistic manner.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n"
